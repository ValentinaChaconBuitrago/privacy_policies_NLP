Itaú Unibanco Holding

The histories of two great Brazilian financial institutions, both once family-owned, came together in a complex operation in November 2008 that gave rise to one of the most important conglomerates in the Southern Hemisphere.

The merger of Itaú and Unibanco created a corporation with a market capitalization that ranks it among largest financial institutions in the world.

Itaú Unibanco offers a comprehensive portfolio of products and services in the Brazilian and international financial markets. Its operational and administrative structure allows for nationwide coverage of Brazil as well as a worldwide presence in major financial centers.

The segmentation strategy employed by both banks for many decades means that, today, an integrated Itaú Unibanco can offer structures, products and services that meet the specific needs of the most varied client profiles.

Client profiles:

• Individuals;
• Micro, small and middle-market companies;
• Public authorities;
• Institutional investors;
• High-income individuals;
• Cash-rich organizations
