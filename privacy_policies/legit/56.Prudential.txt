We also collect information about visitors to our websites through technologies like cookies and pixel tags. The kind of information we may collect includes:

Information from the browser and device you use to visit our websites or to use our mobile applications (such as the type of device, the operating system name and version, and the browser version);

Website visitor data (such as  the number of visitors to our websites, the pages visited, the features used,  and how long you stay on our websites);
How you search for our websites or applications (such as the domain name of the website from which you connect), what websites you click on from our website or emails, and your browsing activities across other websites (provided to us through a third party).
To do this, a unique cookie or pixel tag is placed on your browser.

A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally. Cookies have the ability to store information about web pages viewed and the advertisements viewed or clicked. For registered customers, cookies can also save user information and screen preferences.

A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our websites but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

We also collect information through emails.  From time to time, we may send you emails about our products and services, such as when you purchase a product from us or request us to perform a transaction regarding a product you own.  Prudential and third parties with which we contract may collect information regarding your interaction with these emails, including whether you opened the email, how long you viewed the email, and whether you opened any links on the email.
