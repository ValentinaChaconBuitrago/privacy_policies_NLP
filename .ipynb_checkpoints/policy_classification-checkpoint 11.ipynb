By using this Site, you agree to accept the terms provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than as described in this Policy, we will not give any information about you to others without your express permission.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation Collection and Use\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough this Site is primarily for informational purposes, we may ask you to provide us with your name, email address or other information that could be used to identify you personally.  For example, we may collect this information in the event that you register as a member of this Site, post a comment, sign-up to receive email communications, or submit demographic information as part of a survey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications. If you contact us for support, we will keep an internal record of our communication with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may use your information to contact you regarding the information and services available on our Site, functionality changes to our Site, and special offers we think you\\'ll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please see the \"Updating Your Information\" section below on how to change your preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may also use your information to present a co-branded offer with our partners or affiliates. If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy statement applies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use information gathered about you from our Site statistics (for example, your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our Site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Site uses cookies to enhance your experience with our Site.  Cookies are data files that are placed in your browser to keep track of your personal preferences and to facilitate easy navigation through our Site.  We use cookies to identify you so you don\\'t need to log in each time you visit our Site.  You may opt-out of the use of cookies by altering settings on your browser.  Please note, however, that some areas of the Site will be easier to navigate with the use of cookies..\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Site also contains links to other websites. Unfortunately, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.  We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdating Your Information\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may alter your account information or opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners at any time. We have the following options for changing and modifying your account information or contact preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\n        i.      You may send an email to support@godaddy.com\\r\\n\\r\\n       ii.      You may send mail to Go Daddy at the following postal address: \\r\\n               14455 North Hayden Road, Suite 219, Scottsdale, AZ. 85260 USA\\r\\n\\r\\n      iii.      You may call us at: (480) 505-8800\\r\\n\\r\\n       iv.      You may fax us at: (480) 505-8844\\r\\n\\r\\nSending Emails\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use emails to communicate with you and to send information that you have requested.  We also provide email links to allow you to contact us directly. We strive to promptly reply to your messages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information you send to us may be stored and used to improve this Site and our products, or it may be reviewed and discarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompliance with Laws and Law Enforcement\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN\\'s rules, regulations and policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird Party Service Providers\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may at times provide information about you to third parties to provide various services on our behalf, such as serving advertisements, conducting contests or surveys, performing analyses of our user demographics, shipping of goods or services, and user relationship management. We will only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested service. These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event that we use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf, these companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel GIF or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupplementation of Information\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources (e.g., information from our strategic partners, service providers, or the United States Postal Service).  We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nContests/Surveys\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom time-to-time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you choose to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level - note that you must be 18 or above to enter). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic, and to personalize our Site.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. When we do, that company will be prohibited from using our users\\' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell-A-Friend\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a user elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our Site, we ask the user for the friend\\'s name and email address. Go Daddy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our Site. Go Daddy stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Go Daddy at support@godaddy.com to request the removal of this information from our database.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Happens to my Personal Information if I Opt Out?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you advise us that you wish to opt out of receiving further communications from us, we will place your personally identifiable information in \"deactivated\" status on our relevant databases. However, you should know that placement of your information in \"deactivated\" status does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information as necessary in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransfer of Data Abroad\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are visiting this Site from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.  By visiting this Site and communicating electronically with us, you consent to such transfers.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in Our Practices\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and any other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page, at least thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of the changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nContacting Our Site\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, the practices of this Site, or your dealings with this Site, please contact us at:\\r\\n\\r\\nGo Daddy\\r\\nATTN: Web Team\\r\\n14455 North Hayden Rd.\\r\\nSuite 219\\r\\nScottsdale, AZ, 85260, U.S.A.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevised: 4/5/2013', b'Arbor\\'s Privacy Policy\\nYour right to privacy is very important to us.

We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage.

We provide this online privacy statement to tell you how we may collect, use, share and retain information about you and about the choices you have when you:\\r\\n\\r\\nVisit our websites\\r\\nReceive or reply to email or other electronic communications from us;\\r\\nView or click on our ads or other Prudential online content;\\r\\nInteract with us on social media or websites and applications maintained by other parties\\r\\nWebsites Covered by This Privacy Statement\\r\\nThis privacy statement applies to the Prudential websites and online communications that contain a link to this statement.  It does not apply to those websites or communications that have their own privacy statements or to websites of other companies or entities that are linked to our website.   To learn about the privacy policy of another website, please refer to the privacy statement for that website. By using this website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website is controlled and operated by Prudential from the United States and is intended for residents of the United States.  It is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.  If you are visting from outside the United States, it may not necessarily be consistent with the laws and regulations of your home country.\\r\\n\\r\\nKinds of Information We Collect\\r\\nYou can browse our website without providing any personal information. However, if you choose to take advantage of some of the website\\x92s features or services, we may ask you to provide certain personal information which may include information about you or that may be used to personally identify you or to contact you.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are times when you may choose to give us personal information about you.  For example, you may provide us with your name, telephone number, policy or account number, mailing address, email address, telephone number or date of birth when you:\\r\\n\\r\\nRequest a quote for insurance;\\r\\nRequest that a Prudential representative contact you\\r\\nRegister for a service;\\r\\nInstruct us to perform a transaction;\\r\\nFill out an online survey or form;\\r\\nRegister for online access to access your account; or\\r\\nDownload a mobile application.\\r\\nWe also collect information about visitors to our websites through technologies like cookies and pixel tags. The kind of information we may collect includes:\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation from the browser and device you use to visit our websites or to use our mobile applications (such as the type of device, the operating system name and version, and the browser version);\\r\\nThe IP Address and information related to the IP address (such as domain information, the Internet provider, and your geographic location)\\r\\nWebsite visitor data (such as  the number of visitors to our websites, the pages visited, the features used,  and how long you stay on our websites);\\r\\nHow you search for our websites or applications (such as the domain name of the website from which you connect), what websites you click on from our website or emails, and your browsing activities across other websites (provided to us through a third party).\\r\\nTo do this, a unique cookie or pixel tag is placed on your browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally. Cookies have the ability to store information about web pages viewed and the advertisements viewed or clicked. For registered customers, cookies can also save user information and screen preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our websites but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also collect information through emails.  From time to time, we may send you emails about our products and services, such as when you purchase a product from us or request us to perform a transaction regarding a product you own.  Prudential and third parties with which we contract may collect information regarding your interaction with these emails, including whether you opened the email, how long you viewed the email, and whether you opened any links on the email.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHow We Use Information\\r\\nWe use information collected online in several ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo respond to your request for a call, referral, or quote\\r\\nTo process transactions you request\\r\\nTo tell you about products or services we offer\\r\\nTo authenticate registered customers\\r\\nTo conduct research and analysis\\r\\nTo manage fraud and security risk\\r\\nTo develop, manage, analyze and improve the use of our websites and our advertisements on other websites\\r\\nFor our business purposes, such as developing new products and services and operating our business activities\\r\\nPrudential uses cookies and pixel tags to provide better customer service, and to analyze how visitors use and navigate our websites, so we can improve our websites. Cookies also help us enhance navigation and the functionality of our websites, to securely maintain a session for existing clients accessing password-protected areas, and to personalize aspects of a visitor's experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also collect information from cookies and pixel tags evaluate responses to surveys and our advertisements on other websites and to provide you with specific or relevant content such as articles and educational material when you visit our website.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSome websites use cookies to better serve you when you return to the website. For example, a cookie may remember your user ID to simplify your login to a password-protected page.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrudential itself does not use cookies, pixel tags, or other technologies to track your use of other websites, but Prudential does arrange for advertisements with links to Prudential websites be placed on third party web sites and web pages and may contract with other companies that use cookies, pixel tags, and other online technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with Prudential advertisements and your use of both Prudential and third-party websites.  These other companies may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites.  This information may be used to show you Prudential advertisements and other advertisements that may be of interest to you when you visit other websites.  For more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with it, please visit. http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/ or follow the link at the bottom of this page.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach browser version works in a slightly different way, but you generally have the ability to accept all cookies, be notified before accepting a cookie, block or restrict cookies from certain sites, or reject all cookies. Since many websites use cookies to allow visitors to navigate easily, you may find that some websites or pages do not work well if you reject the cookies associated with them. At this time, Prudential does not respond to browser \\x91do not track\\x92 signals.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDisclosure of Information\\r\\nWe may disclose information collected online to:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prudential family of affiliated companies\\r\\nA Prudential agent or an independent insurance agent to provide you with a policy quotation or other information regarding insurance and financial service products\\r\\nThird parties as permitted or required by law, for example:\\r\\nRegulators\\r\\nVendors that provide service to us\\r\\nLaw enforcement authorities\\r\\nCredit bureaus\\r\\nHow We Protect Your Information\\r\\nPrudential uses reasonable processes and technical security measures that are intended to keep personal information about its customers and employees secure and confidential. We limit access to personal information to those who need access to it to perform their job responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Protection Policy\\r\\n\\r\\nPrudential collects social security numbers in the course of its business activities. Prudential has a privacy policy that protects personal information, including social security numbers. This policy requires that Prudential keep all personal information about its customers and employees, and employees of our vendors and business partners, secure and confidential. Access to personal information is limited to employees who need the information or access to it to perform their job responsibilities.

For example most of our products and services require some form of registration or subscription, while others require a payment to be made. Contact details of our customers and website visitors may also be required from time to time to notify them of competition prizes they may have won.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the personal information we collect, including that obtained from our online enquiry/feedback facilities, is used to help us develop and improve the quality of our products and services, which in turn, provides our customers and website visitors with a more satisfying and enjoyable online experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout collecting and making use of your personal information, we may not be able to provide our online products and services to you.\\r\\nWHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use personal information that we collect to conduct our business of delivering online products and services and to continually improve our relationship with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to do this, we share your personal information with our related companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal information may be used to enable us to send you online promotional material on our range of products and services. You may at any time notify us that you do not wish to receive this material via the unsubscribe facility accompanying the material. Once you have notified us, we will not send you any further promotional material.\\r\\nHOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal Information provided to us\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect and store personal information that is voluntarily provided by our customers as part of doing business with us. Such information may include a customer\\'s full name, date of birth, addresses (including home, postal and email address) and telephone numbers. We also collect and securely store customer\\'s payment details such as their credit card details (where necessary).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect this personal information and make use of these details to provide you with our products and services and to better manage our relationship with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWebsite activity, cookies and related technology\\r\\n\\r\\nWe provide products and services via a number of different websites. When you view one of our websites, our web server records anonymous information such as the time and date the website is viewed and the web pages/URL\\'s requested. This information assists us to improve the structure of our websites and monitor their performance.\\r\\nWe also allow third parties with whom we have entered contractual arrangements (\"Advertising Providers\") to serve advertising on our websites.\\r\\nWe make use of cookies and iframes on our websites and permit Advertising Providers to place and read cookies on end users\\' browsers. These Advertising Providers may use web beacons or similar technologies to collect information in the course of advertisements being served on our websites.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The browser stores the information, and sends the information back to the server each time you request a webpage from the server. The use of cookies is an industry standard, utilized by the majority of website operators.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some parts of our websites, or the products and services provided through our websites, may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you do not enable cookies on your Internet browser.\\r\\nThe National Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") offers an opt-out tool (located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managin/opt_out.asp) for the purpose of allowing consumers to \"opt-out\" of the behavioural advertising delivered by its member companies. Some of the third parties with whom we have entered into contractual arrangements are members of NAI.\\r\\nWe may have iframes embedded on our websites and may enter into contractual arrangements with third parties so that they may analyse your online behaviour. These iframes allow for the collection of non-personally identifiable information about your website visits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIP Addresses\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you access our websites, our website servers register the type of web browsers that you are using and your IP address.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate traffic information to our customers, fraud detection and to generally audit the use of our websites. When you request pages from our websites, our servers may log your IP address.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not normally link IP addresses to any personal information, which means that your session will be logged, but you otherwise remain anonymous.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can and will use your IP address to identify you when it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect the integrity of our services and websites, as well as to protect our interests and those of our other customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome services provided by us, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster\\'s name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those services if you are comfortable with their methods of collection and disclosure of personal information.\\r\\nWHEN WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may disclose your personal information where you have consented to us doing so. This consent may be express (eg. in writing or verbal) or implied from your conduct. There may however be times where we are required to disclose personal information without your consent eg. when it is required or authorized by law.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal information that you provide to us may be shared among our related companies. Our related companies are required to keep such information private and confidential and otherwise deal with such personal information strictly in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order for us to conduct our business, it is necessary to disclose personal information to third parties. We may provide your personal information to third parties with whom we have contracted to provide administrative or other services, including to our affiliated website operators. We will ensure that these third parties are either bound by the Australian Privacy Act or subject to an equivalent law of another jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you utilize our domain name registration services, we provide your personal information to the registry operator for the relevant top level domain name for the purpose of inclusion in their registry database and the WHOIS service as well as to a third party providing registrar data escrow services (as required by our registrar accreditation agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\"ICANN\")). The WHOIS service allows Internet users to query a domain name to find out the identity and contact details of the registrant. The public WHOIS service is a standard feature of domain name systems around the world. Please see auDA\\'s WHOIS policy at http://www.auda.org.au/whois-policy which sets out auDA\\'s guidelines on the collection, disclosure and use of WHOIS data. Please refer to the relevant TLD/ccTLD authority for specific WHOIS data collection policies. We are unable to provide our domain registration services to you without providing your personal information to these parties.\\r\\nTRANSBORDER FLOW OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are in the business of delivering online products and services. The Internet has no boundaries and as such we deal with international organizations and companies such as ICANN, registry operators and other service providers. We reasonably believe that these parties are subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles of fair handling of the information that are substantially similar to the National Privacy Principles. Without the transfer overseas to these entities, we will be unable to provide our online products and services to you.\\r\\nEPP SHARING ARRANGEMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nFabulous.com.au Pty Ltd, has with the consent of .au Domain Administration Limited, the Australian Domain Name Administrator (\"auDA\"), entered into an EPP sharing arrangement with Netstart Pty Ltd ACN 111 018 154, an auDA accredited domain name registrar. \"EPP\" means the connection which the .au registry operator allows registrars to have to the domain name registry. Via the EPP, it is possible for Fabulous.com.au Pty Ltd, Domain8 Pty Ltd and Yexa.com.au Pty Ltd (formerly Domain Candy Pty Ltd) to have access to the registrant information of domain names managed by Netstart Pty Ltd. For this reason, agreements have been signed to protect registrant privacy and whois integrity.\\r\\nPROTECTING KIDS PRIVACY\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are committed to complying with the provisions of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (United States) and its rules and regulations.

Publication of contest winners\\' names, ages, or images for individuals under 13 require parental or guardian consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubject to the below exemptions, the personal information that we collect from your child will be subject to and dealt with in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo information collected from visitors under 13 years of age is used for any promotional purposes whatsoever, unless expressly stated during the collection of this information or during registration for contests or promotions (and in that case, the information collected is used only for the specific contest or promotion).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not allow visitors under 13 years of age to be listed in our member directory or to receive direct promotional communications from us.\\r\\nLINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should be aware that on our affiliated websites, there are links to third party websites.

All requests will be handled as quickly as possible, and we will endeavour to process any request for access within 30 days of its receipt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may refuse access to personal information in certain circumstances such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings with you, where denying access is required or authorized by law, where providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation by an enforcement body or where the request for access is regarded as frivolous or vexatious. If we deny you access to personal information or refuse to correct personal information, we will give you reasons as to why.\\r\\nENSURING PERSONAL INFORMATION IS UP-TO-DATE\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very important that the personal information that we hold about you is complete, accurate and up-to-date.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN\\'s rules, regulations and policies.\\n\\nThird Party Service Providers\\n\\nWe may at times provide information about you to third parties to provide various services on our behalf, such as serving advertisements, conducting contests or surveys, performing analyses of our user demographics, shipping of goods or services, and user relationship management. We will only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested service. These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.\\n\\nIn the event that we use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf, these companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel GIF or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here.\\n\\nSupplementation of Information\\n\\nIn order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources (e.g., information from our strategic partners, service providers, or the United States Postal Service).  We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.\\n\\nContests/Surveys\\n\\nFrom time-to-time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you choose to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level - note that you must be 18 or above to enter). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic, and to personalize our Site.\\n\\nWe may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. When we do, that company will be prohibited from using our users\\' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.\\n\\nTell-A-Friend\\n\\nIf a user elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our Site, we ask the user for the friend\\'s name and email address. Go Daddy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our Site. Go Daddy stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

However, you should know that placement of your information in \"deactivated\" status does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information as necessary in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\\n\\nTransfer of Data Abroad\\n\\nIf you are visiting this Site from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.

So we\\x92ve developed a Privacy Policy\\r\\nthat covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. \\r\\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and\\r\\nlet us know if you have any questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour California Privacy Disclosures | Information Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in Canada\\r\\n\\r\\nCollection and Use of Personal Information\\r\\nPersonal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company. Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat personal information we collect\\r\\nWhen you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.\\r\\nWhen you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.\\r\\nIn the U.S., we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.\\r\\nHow we use your personal information\\r\\nThe personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple\\x92s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don\\x92t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.\\r\\nWe also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\\r\\nWe may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.\\r\\nFrom time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.\\r\\nWe may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple\\x92s products, services, and customer communications.\\r\\nIf you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.\\r\\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\\r\\nWe also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.\\r\\nWe may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, and iTunes Store and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\\r\\nWe may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.\\r\\nWith your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.\\r\\nIf we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies and Other Technologies\\r\\nApple\\x92s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \\x93cookies\\x94 and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: http://oo.apple.com. Alternatively, if you are using iOS 6 or above operating system on your mobile device or iTunes Radio on your computer, you may opt-out by electing Limit Ad Tracking. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information. Opting out through oo.apple.com applies only to Apple advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks. However, if you select Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third party apps are not permitted by contract to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier to serve you targeted ads.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store. Knowing your country and language - and if you are an educator, your school - helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to disable cookies and you\\x92re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to disable cookies. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some of our email messages, we use a \\x93click-through URL\\x94 linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\\r\\n\\r\\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclosure to Third Parties\\r\\nAt times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers. For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier\\x92s respective privacy policies. Personal information will only be shared by Apple to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nService Providers\\r\\nApple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers\\r\\nIt may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - for Apple to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtection of Personal Information\\r\\nApple takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Apple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). When your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third party storage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family\\x97including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases\\x97may be downloaded on to that third party device thereby disclosing any such shared information. [See About Family Sharing for more information.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\\r\\nApple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to Personal Information\\r\\nYou can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account at https://appleid.apple.com/. For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made through the regional Privacy Contact Form.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren\\r\\nWe understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, without first receiving verifiable parental consent we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided consent through the Apple ID for Students Program or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing. For example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple\\x92s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child\\x92s Information; and the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child. Learn more about Family Sharing, the Apple ID for Students program and Restrictions for children\\x92s accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child\\x92s Apple ID, they may contact us through our Privacy Contact Form.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr by using the contact information here.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation-Based Services\\r\\nTo provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices\\x92 approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome location-based services offered by Apple, such as the \\x93Find My iPhone\\x94 feature, require your personal information for the feature to work. You may withdraw consent to Apple and its partners\\x92 and licensees\\x92 collection, use, transmission, processing and maintenance of location and account data at any time by not using the location-based features and turning off the Find My iPhone, Find My Friends, or Location Services settings (as applicable) on your device and computer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird-Party Sites and Services\\r\\nApple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties - for example, a third-party iPhone app. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational Users\\r\\nAll the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Apple abides by the \\x93safe harbor\\x94 frameworks set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected by organizations in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Learn more about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that personal information, including the information provided when using iCloud, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International in Cork, Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc. Personal information collected in the EEA and Switzerland when using iTunes is controlled by iTunes SARL in Luxembourg and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy\\r\\nTo make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Questions\\r\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about Apple\\x92s Privacy Policy or data processing or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please contact us. You can always contact us by phone at the relevant Apple Support number for your country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll such communications are examined and replies issued where appropriate as soon as possible. If you are unsatisfied with the reply received, you may refer your complaint to the relevant regulator in your jurisdiction. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.

Some information may be stored during regular operations to facilitate repair of detected malfunctions; other information is stored only in a crash event by computer systems, such as those commonly called event data recorders (EDR).

We or third parties may then use the combined data to create non-personally identifiable profiles that are shared as consumer segments.\\r\\n    Addressable Marketing Segments - we may use non-personally identifiable data to identify certain consumer segments reachable with advertising.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you would like more information and to know your choices regarding this practice, please visit: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird-Party Applications. We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application, for example through a mobile device application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you prior to accessing our Services using any third party applications.\\r\\n4. Security measures used to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control\\r\\n\\r\\nThe security of your information and Content is important to us. If we collect information from your computer, we encrypt it while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being transferred to us. Once the information reaches our secure servers, as part of our security program, we employ procedures and safeguards, such as maintaining firewalls and having an intrusion detection system, to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information we maintain. However, as with any information travelling over the internet and kept in servers, we cannot guarantee absolute security.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we work with third parties, we require that they maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information and commit that the information is not used for any prohibited purpose. We use commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect our databases and servers against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order for us to provide, develop or improve our Services. Security risks, however, cannot be completely eliminated and we therefore cannot guarantee complete security.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you send us an email, you should know that email is not necessarily secure against interception. Therefore, if your communication will include sensitive information like your bank account, charge card, or social security number, and you prefer not to transmit it electronically, please contact us by postal mail or telephone rather than email. We do not send emails asking for a user\\'s username and password or its Windows username and password or any other username or password.\\r\\n5. Choice and Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe understand and respect that people have different privacy concerns.

However, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. If your personally identifiable information changes (such as ZIP code, phone, email or postal address), or if you no longer desire the Services, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users\\' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing or calling Customer Support.\\r\\n6. Changes to this Privacy Policy\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time.

We will use this information to personalize the functionality we provide on third-party sites, including providing you insights from your professional network and allowing you to share information with your\\xcanetwork.

Note that, as described in Section 2.6, your profile is visible to other Members and through public search depending on your settings. Also, advertising partners may associate personal information collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we contractually require such advertisers to obtain your explicit opt-in consent before doing so.\\rWe may show you sponsored content in your network update stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates. If you take social action (for example, if you \\xd2like\\xd3 or \\xd2comment\\xd3 on the sponsored content), your action may be seen by your network and other Members who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it. Please note that all social actions on SlideShare (e.g. liking certain content, following or being followed by others) are public, unless expressly specified otherwise with respect to premium accounts.\\rWe adhere to\\xcaself-regulatory principles\\xcafor interest based advertising. If you wish to not receive targeted ads from most third party companies, you may opt-out as described\\xcahere. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads or targeted ads by companies not listed with these opt-out tools. You can also\\xcaopt out\\xcaspecifically from our use of cookies and similar technologies to track your behavior on third party sites. For non-Members, this opt out setting is\\xcahere.\\r1.10. Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile Device\\rWe collect information from the devices and networks that you use to access our Services.\\rWhen you visit or leave our Services (whether as a Member or Visitor) by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a third-party site that includes our plugin or cookies (or similar technology), we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed.

We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information (for example, Pulse articles about your area or jobs postings in your location) on our mobile applications and for fraud prevention and security purposes. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time location data being sent to us, and of course we will honor your settings.\\rIn the case of our Android apps, you will be provided notice of the types of data (e.g. location) that will be sent to us. If you choose to use our app after this notice, we process this data to enable registration or preview product features for you (e.g. jobs near you). If you choose not to become a Member, we will delete this information.\\r1.11. Other\\rWe are constantly innovating to improve our Services, which means we may create new ways to collect information on the Services.\\rOur Services are a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the Services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (for example, when the Endorsements feature launched, we began collecting information about skills for which Members were endorsed and the individuals who endorsed them). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information. If we start collecting substantially new types of personal information and materially change how we handle your data, we will modify this Privacy Policy and notify you in accordance with Section 4.3.\\rBack to Top\\r2.

By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile,\\xcayou are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of our User Agreement and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy.\\xcaSupplying to us any information deemed \\xd2sensitive\\xd3 by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part.\\xcaYou can withdraw or modify your consent to our collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your account settings or your profile on\\xcaLinkedIn\\xcaor SlideShare, or by closing yourLinkedIn,\\xcaSlideShare\\xcaand\\xcaPulse\\xcaaccounts.\\r2.2. LinkedIn Communications\\rWe communicate with you using LinkedIn messaging, email, and other ways available to us. We may send you messages relating to the availability of the Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also may send promotional InMail messages to your LinkedIn inbox. You can change your email settings at any time.\\rWe communicate with you through email, notices posted on the LinkedIn websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other means available through the Services, including mobile text messages and push notifications. Examples of these communications include: (1) welcome and engagement communications - informing you about how to best use our Services, new features, updates about other Members you are connected to and their actions, etc.; (2) service communications - these will cover service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of our Services; (3) promotional communications - these include both email and InMail messages (InMail messages are only delivered to your LinkedIn InBox), and may contain promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, including job opportunities and information from companies that are hiring. These messages will be sent to you based on your profile information and messaging preferences. We track the open rate of your InMails to provide your InMail acceptance score. You may change your email and contact preferences at any time by signing into your account and changing your\\xcaLinkedIn\\xcaor\\xcaSlideShare\\xcaemail settings. You can also opt out of promotional messages by sending a request to LinkedIn\\xcaHelp Center.\\rPlease be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us.\\r2.3. User Communications\\rWith certain communications you send on our Services, the recipient can see your name, email address, and some network information.\\rMany communications that you initiate through our Services (for example, an invitation sent to a non-Member) will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Services, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information will be shared with that individual.\\rWe use automatic scanning technology to help protect you and other Members. Such technology checks links and other content in your InMails, network updates and Group contributions to help us identify and block malicious links and malware, reduce spam and optimize the delivery of our Services.\\r2.4. Service Development; Customized Experience\\rWe use the information and content you provide to us to conduct research and development and to customize your experience and try to make it relevant and useful to you.\\rWe use information and content that you and other Members provide to us to conduct\\xcaresearchand development for the improvement of our Services in order to provide you and other Members and Visitors with a better, more intuitive experience and drive membership growth and engagement on our Services and to help connect professionals to economic opportunity.\\rWe also customize your experience and the experiences of others on our Services. For example, when you sign in to your account, we may display the names and photos of new Members who have recently joined your network or recent updates from your connections and companies you follow. We try to show you content, such as news and presentations, that is relevant to you, your industry, or your profession. We also use Members information and content for invitations and communications promoting our Services that are tailored to the recipient.\\r2.5. Sharing Information with Affiliates\\rWe share your information across our different Services, among companies in the LinkedIn family.\\rWe may share your personal information with our affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with LinkedIn) outside of the LinkedIn entity that is your data controller (for example, LinkedIn Corporation may share your information with LinkedIn Ireland, or other LinkedIn operating entities) as reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You are consenting to this sharing.\\rWe combine information internally across different Services. For example, SlideShare may recommend better content to you based on your LinkedIn content preferences and the articles you read on Pulse, and LinkedIn could present you a better tailored network update stream based on your SlideShare activity, whether or not you tied your SlideShare, Pulse and/or LinkedIn accounts (e.g. by signing in SlideShare or Pulse with your LinkedIn account), as we may be able to identify you across different Services using cookies or similar technologies.\\r2.6. Sharing Information with Third Parties\\rAny information you put on your profile and any content you post on LinkedIn may be seen by others.\\rWe don\\xd5t provide any of your non-public information (like your email address) to third parties without your consent, unless required by law, or as described in Sections 2.6 and 2.14 of this Policy.\\rOther people may find your LinkedIn profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter in conjunction with your LinkedIn account.\\rWe offer a \\xd2public profile\\xd3 feature that allows you as a Member to publish portions of your professional profile to the public Internet. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your LinkedIn accountsettings, or limit the publicly visible information in your SlideShare profile. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. Unless you delete them, your profiles on LinkedIn.com and our corresponding app or on SlideShare.net are always viewable on the respective Services.\\rThe visibility of your professional profile to other Members depends on your degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their\\xcausage of the Services, access channels and search types (e.g. by name or by keyword). For example, first degree connections can see your full profile and contact information. Others have more limited access, as detailed in our\\xcaHelp Center. Please note that recruiters and other such professional subscribers can see your full profile even if you did not approve their InMail.\\rWe do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on our Services, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with our other services, such as Groups and Company Pages, except to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) or unless we have your separate consent, unless we have a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Services, our Members, Visitors, or the public. See Section 2.14 for additional details about our compliance with legal requests for information.\\rWe support middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to legal and regulatory archiving requirements, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other activity by a third party for compliance purposes. Content distributed through our sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of our Services. For example, when you post content to a Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results.\\rAlso, if you have opted to bind any of your Service accounts to your Twitter, Facebook or other similar account, you can easily share content from our Services to these third party services, in accordance with your account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective policies of these third parties. Further, we allow third parties to look-up profile information (subject to your privacy settings) using your email address or first and last name information through its profile API (see Section 2.7. below).\\rThird parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload certain information in your contacts stored with us onto their own service. If you choose to share your contacts in this way, you will be granting your third party provider the right to store, access, disclose and use these contacts in the ways described in such third party's terms and privacy policy.\\r2.7. Third Parties Using LinkedIn Platform Services\\rWe work with developers to build Platform Applications using our developer tools. Whether you use Platform Applications is up to you.\\rIf you have given a Platform Application access to your LinkedIn account, you can revoke that permission anytime. Also, you can opt out of providing information to developers through your connections.\\rWe collaborate with and allow third parties to use our developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with our Services. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use our platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (\\xd2Platform Applications\\xd3). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to us.\\rIf you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your\\xcasettings. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do. You may opt out of providing information to third-party developers through your connections by accessing the \\xd2Turn on/off data sharing with third-party applications\\xd3 control in the \\xd2Groups, Companies, and Applications\\xd3 tab under\\xcasettings.\\r2.8. Polls and Surveys\\rWe conduct our own surveys and polls and also help third parties do this type of research. Your participation in surveys or polls is up to you. You may also opt out of getting invitations to participate in surveys.\\rPolls and Surveys may be conducted by us, Members, or third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. We or third parties may follow up with you via InMail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving InMail messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personal information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. We are a member of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (\\xd2CASRO\\xd3) and abides by CASRO guidelines for market research. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your\\xcasettings\\xcato stop receiving these inquiries and requests.\\r2.9. Search\\rOur Services help you search for other professionals, companies, groups, professional content, and jobs.\\rYou can search for Members, employment opportunities, information about companies, and community content from Groups on our Services. For example, you can find Members with particular expertise or experience, or Members that you may know from your industry or profession. You can also find employment opportunities and information about companies. You can also find content from Groups, SlideShare and Pulse. We use personal information from our Services, including Member profiles, Groups content, and Company Pages, to inform and refine our search service.\\r2.10. Groups\\rYou are responsible for any information you post on our Services, and this content will be accessible to others.\\rIf you participate in Groups, share content on your network update stream, or import a blog or other content, you should be aware that any information you choose to disclose using these services can be read, collected, and used by other Members in these forums, developers, and other third parties, including advertisers. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. Your Groups contributions are typically searchable on our Services and some content in Groups may be public and searchable on the Internet if the group owner has not closed the group for public discussions. You can identify closed groups by the padlock icon next to the group name. You can remove your Groups posts at any time. However, others may have copied and used the information that you shared.\\r2.11. Testimonials and Advertisements Placed through LinkedIn Ads\\rIf you provide any testimonials about our goods or services or place advertisements through the LinkedIn Ads, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. For more information about LinkedIn Ads, please see the\\xcaLinkedIn Ads Terms of Use.\\r2.12. Talent Recruiting, Marketing and Sales Solutions\\rWe offer a premium service to recruiters and others, which can be used to search for, organize, and communicate with potential candidates or offer business opportunities. In some cases we allow the export of public profile information. You can control how your information is exported by changing which parts of your public profile are accessible to search engines.\\rWe offer customized people-search functionality along with organizational and communications tools (including activity alerts) as part of our talent recruiting, marketing and sales solutions. These services allow subscribers - generally, enterprises and professional organizations - to export limited information from Members\\xd5 public profiles, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and location (for example, San Francisco Bay Area), in order to effectively manage candidate sourcing. You may limit or prevent such subscribers from exporting your profile information by configuring your\\xcapublic profile visibility settings\\xcato restrict access to these fields. We do not provide email or other contact information to these subscribers. However, if you post that information as part of your profile it will be available to them and others. A recruiter or other such subscriber may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of our Services, such as a resume, in connection with our platform. Any personal information obtained independently of our Services will not be added by us to your profile and is not under our control but is subject to the policies of our recruiting, marketing or sales solution subscriber. We store such information on behalf of such subscriber who can remove it at any time. We do not further process such information.\\r2.13. Pages for Companies, Schools, Influencers, and Other Entities\\rCompanies and other entities can create pages on our Services. If you follow one of these pages, non-identifiable information about you will be provided to the page\\xd5s administrators.\\rCertain pages on the Services are public (e.g., company and college pages), and any communications or information shared through them will be accessible by the entity that created them. If you follow a person or organization, you will be listed among its followers, which can be viewed by others including the page owner. We use aggregate information about followers and viewers to provide data about such pages\\xd5 performance (for example, visits and updates).\\r2.14. Compliance with Legal Process and Other Disclosures\\rWe may disclose your personal information if compelled by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if necessary to enforce our User Agreement.\\rIt is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a Member or Visitor when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, whether in the United States, Ireland, or other jurisdictions, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the User Agreement, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal information when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but do not commit to challenge every demand. To find out more about how we engage with government requests for data see our\\xcaLaw Enforcement Data Request Guidelines.\\r2.15. Disclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of LinkedIn Corporation\\rIf there is a change in control or sale of all or part of LinkedIn, we may share your information with a third party, who will have the right to use that information in line with this Privacy Policy.\\rWe may also disclose your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of LinkedIn Corporation, a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events.

Service Providers\\rWe may employ third parties to help us with the Services\\rWe may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g. maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development). These third parties have limited access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated to LinkedIn not to disclose or use it for other purposes.\\r2.17 Data Processing Outside Your Country\\rWe may process your information outside the country where you live.\\rWe may transfer your information and process it outside your country of residence, wherever LinkedIn, its\\xcaaffiliates\\xcaand service providers operate.\\rBack to Top\\r3.

Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Members copied or exported out of our Services, because this information may not be in our control. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.\\r3.2. Data Retention\\rWe keep your information for as long as your account is active or as needed. For example, we may keep certain information even after you close your account if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this agreement.\\rWe retain the personal information you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you services. We may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between Members, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement. We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Our Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with Section 3.1., except in the case of our plugin impression data (i.e., the information that you visited on sites carrying our social plugin, but which you did not click on), which we de-personalize within 7 days (although we do maintain 30 days worth of webserver logs for security, debugging, and site stability purposes only) by creating aggregate data sets that cannot be traced back to individuals.\\rBack to Top\\r4.

Some of the information that you submit during the registration process or while making a purchase may be personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your name, business name, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, etc.). Also, if you place an order, you may be required to provide financial information.\\n\\nWhen you visit the Web Site, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you choose to register with the Web Site, during the registration process you will be asked for both personal and demographic information, most of which is required in order to complete the registration. We will inform you which information is optional. If you opt not to register with the Web Site, you still can visit the Web Site but may not be able to receive or view certain content such as our newsletter.\\n\\nHD Guru does not have control over the privacy policies applied by any other party that you may disclose information to.

Like most Web site operators, we track IP addresses, use both session and persistent cookies, and assign Internet tags.

Some of these Special Programs may involve sharing information with a third party and Pfizer will provide you with notice of this. You may be offered the opportunity to agree to or opt-out of the sharing of your information with such third party.

We are also able to offer our visitors a more customized, relevant experience on our sites using these Tools by delivering content and functionality based on your preferences and interests. If you have provided us with personal information, e.g., through a registration or a request for certain materials, we may associate this personal information with information gathered through the Tools.

Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users\\' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use data collection devices such as \"cookies\" on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. \"Cookies\" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a \"cookie\". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.

You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a Microsoft account, submit a search query to Bing, speak a voice command to Cortana, upload a document to OneDrive, or contact us for support. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe data we collect depends on the services and features you use, and includes the following.\\r\\n\\r\\nName and contact data. We collect your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.\\r\\n\\r\\nCredentials. We collect passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemographic data. We collect data about you such as your age, gender, country and preferred language.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterests and favorites. We collect data about your interests and favorites, such as the teams you follow in a sports app, the stocks you track in a finance app, or the favorite cities you add to a weather app. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favorites may also be inferred or derived from other data we collect.\\r\\n\\r\\nPayment data. We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsage data. We collect data about how you and your device interact with our services. This includes data, such as the features you use, the items you purchase, the web pages you visit, and the search terms you enter. This also includes data about your device and the network you use to connect to our services, including IP address, device identifiers (such as the IMEI number for phones), regional and language settings. It includes information about the operating systems and other software installed on your device, including product keys. And it includes data about the performance of the services and any problems you experience with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nContacts and relationships. We collect data about your contacts and relationships if you use a Microsoft service to manage contacts, or to communicate or interact with other people or organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation data. We collect data about your location, which can be either precise or imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Position System (GPS) data, as well as data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, we collect when you enable location-based services or features. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your IP address or data that indicates where you are located with less precision, such as at a city or postal code level.\\r\\n\\r\\nContent. We collect content of your files and communications when necessary to provide you with the services you use. For example, if you receive an email using Outlook.com, we need to collect the content of that email in order to deliver it to your inbox, display it to you, enable you to reply to it, and store it for you until you choose to delete it. Examples of this data include: the content of your documents, photos, music or video you upload to a Microsoft service such as OneDrive, as well as the content of your communications sent or received using Microsoft services such Outlook.com or Skype, including the:\\r\\n\\r\\nsubject line and body of an email,\\r\\ntext or other content of an instant message,\\r\\naudio and video recording of a video message, and\\r\\naudio recording and transcript of a voice message you receive or a text message you dictate.\\r\\nWe also collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, or questions and information you provide for customer support. When you contact us, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded. If you enter our retail stores, your image may be captured by our security cameras.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a service, you may not be able to use some features or services.\\r\\n\\r\\nService-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those services.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nHow We Use Personal Data\\r\\nMicrosoft uses the data we collect for three basic purposes, described in more detail below: (1) to operate our business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, (2) to send communications, including promotional communications, and (3) to display advertising.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect through the various Microsoft services you use to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. For example, Cortana can use the favorite sports teams you add to the  MSN Sports app to provide information relevant to your interests, or Windows Store can use information about how you use a variety of services to make personalized app recommendations. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.\\r\\n\\r\\nProviding and improving our services. We use data to provide and improve the services we offer and perform essential business operations. This includes operating the services, maintaining and improving the performance of the services, including developing new features, research, and providing customer support. Examples of such uses include the following.\\r\\n\\r\\nProviding the Services. We use data to carry out your transactions with us and to provide our services to you. Often, those services include personalized features and recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment, and tailor your service experiences based on your activities, interests and location.\\r\\n\\r\\nCustomer support. We use data to diagnose service problems, repair customers\\' devices, and provide other customer care and support services.\\r\\nProduct activation. We use data - including device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network and subscription identifiers - in order to activate software and devices that require activation.\\r\\nService Improvement. We use data to continually improve our services, including adding new features or capabilities, such as using search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, or using audio recordings from voice input features to improve speech recognition accuracy.\\r\\nSecurity, Safety and Dispute Resolution. We use data to protect the security and safety of our services and our customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to confirm the validity of software licenses, to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. Our security features and services can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. Our communications and file syncing services systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing or malware links. We may block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.\\r\\nBusiness Operations. We use data to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.\\r\\nCommunications. We use data we collect to deliver and personalize our communications with you. For example, we may contact you by email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending, let you know when security updates are available, remind you about items left in your online shopping cart, update you or inquire about a service or repair request, invite you to participate in a survey, or tell you that you need to take action to keep your account active. Additionally, you can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing email subscriptions and promotional communications, please visit the  Access and Controls section of this privacy statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising. Many of our services are supported by advertising. We use the data we collect to help select the ads Microsoft delivers - whether on our own services or on services offered by third parties. The ads we select may be based on your current location, search query, or the content you are viewing. Other ads are targeted based on your likely interests or other information that we learn about you over time using demographic data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data, and location data - which we refer to as \"interest-based advertising\" in this statement. Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you. You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our opt-out page. More information about advertising controls is available in the Access and Controls section of this privacy statement. Further details regarding our advertising-related uses of data include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising Industry Best Practices and Commitments. Microsoft is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. We also adhere to the following self-regulatory programs:\\r\\nIn the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)\\r\\nIn Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)\\r\\nIn Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l\\'Alliance de la publicit\\xe9 num\\xe9rique du Canada (DAAC)\\r\\nChildren and Advertising. We do not deliver interest-based advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 13 years of age.\\r\\nData Retention. For interest-based advertising, we retain data for no more than 13 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.\\r\\nData Sharing. In some cases, we share with advertisers reports about the data we have collected on their sites or ads. We may also share data directly with service providers to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising partners. For instance, Microsoft uses a service provider to match your Microsoft cookie ID and account data with data an advertiser may have about you (such as your recent purchases from them). This is done so the advertiser can reach you with an ad it thinks may be relevant to you. However, the service provider we use acts as a trusted third party and does not share any personal data that Microsoft or the advertiser has about you.\\r\\nData Collected by Other Advertising Companies. Advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. Additionally, Microsoft partners with third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: A9, AOL Advertising, AppNexus, Criteo, MediaMath, nugg.adAG, Rocket Fuel, Yahoo!. You may find more information on each company\\'s practices, including the choices it offers, by clicking on the company names above. Many of them are also members of the NAI or DAA, which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nReasons We Share Personal Data\\r\\nWe share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, such as when you send an email to a friend, share photos and documents on OneDrive, or link accounts with another service. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we\\'ve hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:\\r\\n\\r\\ncomply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;\\r\\nprotect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of the services, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;\\r\\noperate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or\\r\\nprotect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services - however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer\\'s private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.\\r\\nFor more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Law Enforcement Transparency Report, available at http://microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/reporting/transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that some of our services include links to services of third parties whose privacy practices differ from Microsoft\\'s. If you provide personal data to any of those services, your data is governed by their privacy statements.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nHow to Access & Control Your Personal Data\\r\\nYou can view or edit your personal data online for many Microsoft services. You can also make choices about Microsoft\\'s collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you use. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft account. If you wish to access or edit the profile information and payment information in your Microsoft account, change your password, add security information or close your account, you can do so by visiting https://account.microsoft.com. From here, you can also access controls for other Microsoft services.\\r\\nBing and Cortana. You can access or clear your Bing search history, redeem Bing Rewards, view and modify interests, and manage other Cortana data at https://www.bing.com/account/general.\\r\\nSkype. If you wish to access or edit the profile information and payment information in your Skype account or change your password, you can sign into your account at https://login.skype.com/login.\\r\\nXbox. If you use Xbox Live or Xbox.com, you can view or edit your personal data, including billing and account information, privacy settings, online safety and data sharing preferences by accessing My Xbox on the Xbox console or on the Xbox.com website.\\r\\nMicrosoft Store. You can access your Microsoft Store profile and account information by visiting https://www.microsoftstore.com/ and clicking on \"View account\" or \"Order history.\"\\r\\nMicrosoft.com. You can access and update your profile on microsoft.com by visiting the Microsoft.com Profile Center. If you have a Microsoft Developer Network public profile, you can access and edit it at https://connect.microsoft.com/profile.aspx.\\r\\nIf you cannot access personal data collected by Microsoft services via the links above or directly through the services, you can always contact Microsoft by using our web form. We will respond to requests to access or delete your personal data within 30 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Communications Preferences\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by visiting and signing into Microsoft\\'s Promotional Communications Manager with your personal Microsoft account, which allows you to update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners. If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this web form. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft services, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Advertising Choices\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft by visiting our opt-out page.When you opt out, your selection will be stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account. It will then apply on any device where you use that account, and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device. If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows Settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes (including providing our services, analytics and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data from being collected. Nor does it mean you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads. However, if you do opt out, the ads you receive will no longer be interest-based and may be less relevant to your interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrowser-Based Controls\\r\\n\\r\\nCookie Controls. Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement.\\r\\nTracking Protection. Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) has a feature called Tracking Protection that will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add. By limiting calls to these sites, the browser will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you.\\r\\nBrowser Controls for \"Do Not Track.\" Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nCookies & Similar Technologies\\r\\nMicrosoft uses cookies (small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies to provide our services and help collect data. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Microsoft apps use other identifiers, such as the advertising ID in Windows, for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nStoring your Preferences and Settings. Settings that enable our services to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time may be stored on your device. For example, if you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device.\\r\\nSign-in and Authentication. When you sign into a site using your personal Microsoft account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page.\\r\\nInterest-Based Advertising. Microsoft uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that is most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described in the Access and Control section of this privacy statement.\\r\\nAnalytics. In order to provide our services, we use cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our services.\\r\\nSome of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the main reasons we typically set cookies. If you visit one of our websites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:\\r\\n\\r\\nCookie name\\tDescription\\r\\nMUID\\r\\n\\r\\nIdentifies unique web browsers visiting Microsoft sites. It is used for advertising, site analytics and other operational purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nANON\\r\\n\\r\\nContains the ANID, a unique identifier derived from your Microsoft account, which is used for advertising, personalization, and operational purposes. It is also used to preserve your choice to opt out of interest-based advertising from Microsoft, if you have chosen to associate the opt-out with your Microsoft account.\\r\\n\\r\\nCC\\r\\n\\r\\nContains a country code as determined from your IP address.\\r\\n\\r\\nRPSTAuth, MSNRPSAuth, KievRPSAuth\\r\\n\\r\\nHelps to authenticate you when you sign in with your Microsoft account.\\r\\n\\r\\nNAP\\r\\n\\r\\nContains an encrypted version of your country, postal code, age, gender, language and occupation, if known, based on your Microsoft account profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nMH\\r\\n\\r\\nAppears on co-branded sites where Microsoft is partnering with an advertiser. This cookie identifies the advertiser so the right ad is selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nACH01\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintains information about which ads you clicked on and where you clicked on the ad.\\r\\n\\r\\nTOptOut\\r\\n\\r\\nRecords your decision not to receive interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the cookies Microsoft sets when you visit our websites, third parties may also set cookies when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties\\' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to Control Cookies\\r\\n\\r\\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by clicking Settings > Privacy > Cookies. Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies in other browsers may be available in each browser\\'s privacy or help documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain features of Microsoft services depend on cookies. Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use those features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional privacy controls that can impact cookies, including the Tracking Protection feature of Microsoft browsers, are described in the Access and Control section of this privacy statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Use of Web Beacons and Analytics Services\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our sites, count users who have visited those sites and deliver co-branded services. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to placing web beacons on our own sites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their sites or in their advertisements. This helps us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Microsoft site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser\\'s site.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Microsoft services often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites or other services. However, we prohibit these analytics providers from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access information that directly identifies you (such as your name or email address). You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these analytics providers by clicking the following links:\\r\\n\\r\\nFlurry Analytics: http://flurry.com/legal-privacy/end-user-opt-out\\r\\nGoogle Analytics: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout (requires you to install a browser add-on)\\r\\nKissmetrics: https://kissmetrics.com/user-privacy\\r\\nMixpanel: https://mixpanel.com/optout\\r\\nNielsen: http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&nav=1#Optoutchoices\\r\\nOmniture (Adobe): http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html\\r\\nVisible Measures: http://corp.visiblemeasures.com/viewer-settings\\r\\nWebTrends: https://ondemand.webtrends.com/support/optout.asp\\r\\nOther Similar Technologies\\r\\nIn addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our services can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or \"Flash cookies\") and Silverlight Application Storage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies.\" Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or \"Flash cookies\" to store data on your computer. To manage or block Flash cookies, go to http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverlight Application Storage. Web sites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, see the Silverlight section of this statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nMicrosoft account\\r\\nWith a Microsoft account, you can sign into Microsoft services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. When you create your own Microsoft account, we refer to that account as a personal Microsoft account. When your account is created and provided to you by your organization, such as your school or employer, using Microsoft\\'s Azure Active Directory (AAD), we refer to that account as a work or school account.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating and using your personal Microsoft account. When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked for certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some services, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign into and use some Microsoft services without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft services. For example, people who know your display name, email address or phone number can use it to search for you on Skype and send you an invite to connect with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSigning in. When you sign into your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the service you signed into, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.\\r\\n\\r\\nSigning into Microsoft. Signing into your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across services and devices, and allows you to access and use cloud data storage and other enhanced features and settings. When you sign into your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you into services that use Microsoft account that you access on that device. When you are signed in, some services will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft services, including in your communications, social interactions and public posts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSigning into third-party services. If you sign into a third-party service with your Microsoft account, you will be asked to consent to share the account data required by that service. The service will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and whether your account has been deactivated. The third party can use or share your data according to its own practices and policies. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each service you sign into in order to determine how it will use the data it collects.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal Microsoft accounts received from third parties. If you received your personal Microsoft account from a third party, like an Internet service provider, that third party may have rights over your account, including the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. You should carefully review any additional terms the third party provided you to understand what it can do with your account.\\r\\n\\r\\nConnecting your personal Microsoft account to your social network accounts. You may connect your personal Microsoft account to your accounts on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn in order to access data from those social networks from within Microsoft services. If you choose to do so, we will store data about your social network accounts on our servers so that we can display updated data from your social network account. You can disconnect a social network account from your personal Microsoft account at any time at https://profile.live.com/services.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing work or school accounts. You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school Microsoft account. If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. If you sign in to Microsoft services with a work or school account, the owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. Your use of the services may be subject to your organization\\'s policies, if any. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of these organizations, which may differ from those of Microsoft.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nOther Important Privacy Information\\r\\nBelow you will find additional privacy information you may find important. You can also find more information on Microsoft\\'s commitment to protecting your privacy at http://www.microsoft.com/privacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nSecurity of Personal Data\\r\\nMicrosoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWhere We Store and Process Personal Data\\r\\nPersonal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States or in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data. Microsoft also adheres to the principles of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nOur Retention of Personal Data\\r\\nMicrosoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.\\r\\nIn Outlook.com, when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion.\\r\\nIf you remove a credit card from your account, Microsoft will retain transaction records containing your credit card number for as long as reasonably necessary to complete any existing transactions, to comply with Microsoft\\'s legal and reporting requirements, and for the detection and prevention of fraud.\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nCollection of Data From Children\\r\\nWhen a Microsoft service collects age it will either block users under 13 or will ask them to provide consent from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under 13 to provide more data than is necessary to provide the service.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce parental consent is granted, the child\\'s account is treated much like any other account. The child may have access to communication services like email, instant messaging and online message boards and may be able to communicate freely with other users of all ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nParents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children\\'s personal data. For example, parents can access their personal Microsoft account and click on \"Permissions.\" For users of Minecraft and other Mojang games, parents can contact us at https://account.mojang.com/terms#contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nEnterprise Services\\r\\nEnterprise Services are those Microsoft services and related offerings that that are offered or designed primarily for use within an enterprise, including Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Intune and Yammer, for which an organization (our \"customer\") contracts with Microsoft for the services. In the event of a conflict between a Microsoft privacy statement and the terms of any agreement(s) between a customer and Microsoft, the terms of those agreement(s) will control.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur customers, in turn, may administer the Enterprise Services to end users. If you use a work or school Microsoft account(i.e. an email address provided by your organization, such as your employer or school) to sign into Enterprise Services, the owner of the domain associated with your email address may: (i) control and administer your account and (ii) access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security policies or practices of our customers, which may differ from those of Microsoft. If your organization is administering your use of the Enterprise Services, please direct your privacy inquiries to your administrator.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nPreview Releases\\r\\nMicrosoft offers preview, insider, beta or other pre-release features and services (\"previews\") to enable you to evaluate them while providing feedback, including performance and usage data, to Microsoft.  As a result, previews can automatically collect additional data, provide fewer controls, and otherwise employ different privacy and security measures than those typically present in our services.  If you participate in previews, we may contact you about your feedback or your interest in continuing to use the service after general release.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nChanges to This Privacy Statement\\r\\nWe will update this privacy statement when necessary to reflect customer feedback and changes in our services. When we post changes to this statement, we will revise the \"last updated\" date at the top of the statement. If there are material changes to the statement or in how Microsoft will use your personal data, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how Microsoft is protecting your information.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nHow to Contact Us\\r\\nIf you have a technical or support question, please visit http://support.microsoft.com to learn more about Microsoft Support offerings.

To contact us in relation to Skype software or products, please submit a support request to the Skype customer support team.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find the Microsoft subsidiary in your country or region, see http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nService specific details:\\r\\nBing\\r\\nBing services include search and mapping services, as well as the Bing Toolbar and Bing Desktop apps. Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as MSN Apps and Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the search or command terms you provide, along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. If you use Bing voice-enabled services, additionally your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Ask Cortana or Bing Lookup, to search a particular word or phrase within a web page or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results. \\r\\n\\r\\nSearch Suggestions. For the Search Suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience to conduct a search will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, go to Bing settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBing Rewards Program. When you are signed in with your Microsoft account, we use data about your interactions with Bing services to provide rewards credits. To opt out of this feature, go here.\\r\\n\\r\\nBing Experience Improvement Program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar. If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you, or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetention and de-identification. We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers after 18 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonalization through Microsoft account. Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit the Bing Settings page to manage your personalization settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nManaging Search History. Bing\\'s Search History service provides an easy way to revisit the search terms you\\'ve entered and results you\\'ve clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history in Bing Settings. Clearing your history removes it from the Search History service and prevents that history from being displayed on the site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-Microsoft services that use Bing. You may access Bing-powered experiences when using other non-Microsoft services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners that may include date, time, IP address, a unique identifier and other search-related data. This data will be sent to Microsoft in order to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the non-Microsoft services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\\r\\n\\r\\nSearch query passed in referral URL. When you click on a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit - such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the URL of the site you came from (in this case, the Bing search results page). Because the URL of the Bing search results page contains the text of the search query you entered (which could include names, addresses, or other identifying information), the destination website will be able to determine the search term you entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your browser is enabled to allow pages to pre-load in the background for faster performance, when your browser loads a page in the background, it will have the same effect as if you visited that page, including sending the Bing search results page URL (containing your search query) and downloading any cookies that page sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing search data for research and development purposes. We share some de-identified search query data with selected third parties for research and development purposes. Before we do so, we remove all unique identifiers such as IP addresses and cookie IDs from the data. We also run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for other purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nCortana\\r\\nCortana is your personal assistant. Cortana works best when it can learn about you and your activities by using data from your device, your personal Microsoft account, third-party services and other Microsoft services. To enable Cortana to provide personalized experiences and relevant suggestions, Microsoft collects and uses various types of data, such as your device location, data from your calendar, the apps you use, data from your emails and text messages, who you call, your contacts and who you interact with on your device. Cortana also learns about you by collecting data about how you use your device and other Microsoft services, such as your music, alarm settings, whether the lock screen is on, what you view and purchase, your browse and Bing search history, and more. You can manage what data Cortana uses, and what it knows about you in Cortana Settings and Notebook. More about the individual features, and how to manage them can be found at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=522360.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation services. Cortana regularly collects and uses your current location, location history, and other location signals (such as locations tagged on photos you upload to OneDrive). This location data is used to give you the most relevant notices and results and to make suggestions that help save you time, such as traffic and location based reminders. Cortana can only work if location services are on, so if you turn them off, Cortana will be disabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nText messages and email. Cortana accesses your messages to do a variety of things such as: allowing you to add events to your calendar, apprising you of important messages, and keeping you up to date on events or other things that are important to you, like package or flight tracking. Cortana also uses your messages to help you with planning around your events and offers other helpful suggestions and recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunications History. Cortana learns who is most important to you from your call, text message, and email history. This is used to keep track of people most relevant to you and your preferred methods of communication, flag important messages for you and improve other Cortana services such as speech recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeech and Input Personalization. To help Cortana better understand the way you speak and your voice commands, speech data is sent to Microsoft to build personalized speech models and improve speech recognition and user intent understanding. On Windows devices, Cortana can only work if Input Personalization is on, so if you turn it off, Cortana will be disabled. See the Windows Input Personalization section for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft apps and services. Cortana uses data collected through other Microsoft services to provide personalized suggestions. For example, Cortana uses data collected by the MSN Sports app so it can automatically display information about the teams you follow. It also learns your favorite places from Microsoft\\'s Maps app so it can offer better suggestions. Your interests in Cortana\\'s Notebook can be used by other Microsoft services, such as Bing or MSN, to customize your interests, preferences, and favorites in those experiences as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird-party services. Cortana also allows you to connect to third-party services for additional personalized experiences based upon data from the third-party service. For example, choosing to sign into Facebook or LinkedIn within Cortana allows Microsoft to access certain Facebook or LinkedIn data so that Cortana and Bing can give you more personalized recommendations. You can manage Cortana\\'s connections to third-party services in the Cortana Notebook.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrowsing history. If you choose to send your full browsing history to Microsoft in Microsoft Edge (see the Microsoft Edge description in the Windows section of this statement), Cortana can provide suggestions based on the sites you visit in Microsoft Edge. Cortana won\\'t collect information about sites you visit in InPrivate tabs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSearch history. Your Bing search queries - even if Cortana does the searching for you - are treated like any other Bing search queries and are used as described in the Bing section.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nGroove Music/Movies & TV\\r\\nGroove Music lets you easily play your music collection, make playlists, buy music and stream custom radio stations. Microsoft Movies & TV allows you to play your video collection, and rent or buy movies and TV episodes. These services were formerly offered as Xbox Music and Video.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help you discover content that may interest you, Microsoft will collect data about what content you play, the length of play, and the rating you give it. If you enable Cortana on your device, Microsoft will collect and use data related to the music you play via Groove Music to provide personalized experiences and relevant suggestions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo enrich your experience when playing content, Groove Music and Movies & TV will display related information about the content you play and the content in your music and video libraries, such as the album title, cover art, song or video title, and other information, where available. To provide this information, Groove Music and Movies & TV send an information request to Microsoft containing standard device data, such as your device IP address, device software version, your regional and language settings, and an identifier for the content.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you use Groove Music or Movies & TV to access content that has been protected with Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM), it may automatically request media usage rights from an online rights server and download and install DRM updates in order to let you play the content. See the DRM information in the Silverlight section of this privacy statement for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nMicrosoft Health Services\\r\\nMicrosoft Health services include the Microsoft Band devices, Microsoft Health apps, HealthVault, and other related services. The Band helps you keep track of data like heart rate and steps taken. The Band can also use Cortana to take notes and receive notifications from your phone. The Microsoft Health app sends data to Microsoft\\'s servers and allows you to manage and control the data. The app provides a channel for other apps on your phone to send notifications to the Band. HealthVault is a personal health platform that lets you gather, edit, add to, and store health data online. With HealthVault, you can also choose to share your health data with family, caregivers, and health care professionals.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Health apps and devices collect and store your data to provide and improve the services. Health data you provide through Microsoft Health services or store in HealthVault is not combined with data from other Microsoft services, or used for other purposes without your explicit consent. For example, Microsoft does not use your health record data to market or advertise to you without your opt-in consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nMicrosoft Health and Band\\r\\nMicrosoft Health includes the Microsoft Band devices, the Microsoft Health apps, Microsoft Band Sync app, and other related services. For more information about the data collection and privacy in Microsoft Health apps and devices, go here\\r\\n\\r\\nActivity and Profile Data. Microsoft Band sensors help you keep track of data like your heart rate, steps, calories burned, and sleep. Examples of types of activities you can choose to track are runs, workouts, and sleep.

Other data used to create your profile comes from your personal Microsoft account.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance and Usage Data. To provide you the best service, we collect and automatically upload statistics about the performance and your use of the Microsoft Health apps and devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess and Control. You can visit the Microsoft Health app and the Microsoft Health web dashboard to view and manage your data. In the Microsoft Health app, you can view and update your profile data, remove any service you do not wish to use, and view past activities. You can delete specific activity details in the Microsoft Health app. When you delete a specific activity, the event is deleted from the Microsoft Health service; however, the basic sensor data captured by the devices remain in the Microsoft Health service. You can cancel your Microsoft Health account at any time by contacting Customer Support here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird-Party Apps. If you connect a third-party application to Microsoft Health, the use of your activity information is subject to the privacy practices and terms of use for the third-party service. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy statement and terms of use for any third-party service before you connect.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotifications on the Band. When you enable notifications on your phone, the notifications you select through the Microsoft Health will display on the Band. Microsoft Health provides a channel for other apps on your phone to send notifications to the Band, but does not retain data about the content contained within the notifications. Examples of the types of notifications you can choose to receive on the Band are email messages, calendar reminders, phone calls received, text messages, social updates (such as Facebook and Twitter), weather and finance. To find a more detailed list, click here. There are a limited number of messages the Band will display for each notification, and when more messages appear, older messages are removed from the Band. In your Microsoft Health app, you can choose which notifications show up on the Band. To clear current notifications from your Band, turn the Band off.\\r\\n\\r\\nCortana. The Band allows you to take notes, perform queries, and set reminders with your voice, if Cortana is enabled on your phone. To learn more about how Cortana manages your data, see the Cortana section of this privacy statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation Services. Microsoft Band has built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities, which let you map your run or bike ride without having to carry your phone with you. You can choose whether GPS is enabled for each activity. If you enable GPS for an activity, you can view the activity map in the Microsoft Health app. When you start Golf mode on the Band, we automatically turn on GPS. It turns off when you end golf mode. \\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nHealthVault\\r\\nHealthVault is a personal health platform that lets you gather, edit, store, and share health data online. With HealthVault, you can control your own health records. You can also choose to share your health data with family, caregivers, health care professionals, mobile apps, health-related devices, and online tools. For more information about the data collection and privacy in HealthVault, go to here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSigning into HealthVault. To sign into HealthVault, you can use Microsoft account credentials or sign-in credentials from certain other providers. If you close your Microsoft account or lose your account credentials, you may not be able to access your data. You can use more than one credential with HealthVault to help ensure continued access. Before using non-Microsoft credentials with HealthVault, we recommend you review the security and privacy commitments offered by the issuer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealthVault Account and Health Records. To create a new HealthVault account, you must provide personal data such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal code and country/region. Depending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information. A HealthVault account allows you to manage one or more health records, such as the ones you create for yourself and your family members. You can add or remove data to a health record you manage at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., HealthVault assigns each health record an email address. When a message is received at that email address, the message and attachments are automatically added to the HealthVault record, and a notification email is sent to the custodians of that record. The email service in HealthVault uses \"Direct,\" a protocol designed specifically to communicate with health care providers. For that reason, HealthVault email can only be sent and received with providers that use a system that\\'s set up to do that. Custodians can add or disable record email addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing Health Data. A key value of HealthVault is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals. By default, you are the custodian of any records you create. Custodians have the highest level of access to a health record. As a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through HealthVault. You can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access, and whether they can modify the data in the record. When you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to services (for example, someone with view-only access can grant a service view-only access). Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services. No service has access to your data through HealthVault unless an authorized user grants it access through HealthVault. HealthVault allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests. For each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information.\\r\\n\\r\\nA service you authorize for a record will get the full name associated with your HealthVault account, the nickname of the authorized record(s), and your relationship to that record. If the service would like the email address created by HealthVault for the specific record, the service may request this when you grant them access to the record. The service will continue to have access through HealthVault until you revoke the permission. Microsoft can revoke a service\\'s access to HealthVault if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Microsoft. However, except for restricting the access they have to your HealthVault data, we do not control or monitor those services, and their privacy practices will vary.\\r\\n\\r\\nReports to U.S. Providers. In the United States, we enable participating providers to obtain reports about whether the information they send to a record is used. This feature supports the \"meaningful use\" objective of the HITECH Act, which provides incentives for health care providers to send their patients copies of their medical information electronically. Providers that participate can get reports that include a number the provider uses to identify the patient within its system, and whether the user took one of the \"qualifying actions\" in HealthVault (but no information about which action). \"Qualifying action\" currently includes activities such as viewing, downloading, or transmitting health information via email. You can turn off reporting for your records.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess and controls. You can review, edit or delete your HealthVault account data, or close your HealthVault account at any time. Only custodians can permanently delete an item. When you delete a heath record, it is deleted from all users who had access to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you close your HealthVault account, we delete all records for which you are the sole custodian. If you share custodian access for a record, you can decide whether to delete the record. Microsoft will wait a limited amount of time before permanently deleting your data in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your health data.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealthVault maintains a full history of each access, change or deletion by users and services, which includes the date, action and name of the person or service. Custodians of records can examine the history of those records.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmail Communications. We will use the email address you provide when you create your HealthVault account to send you an email requesting that you validate your email address, to include in sharing invitations you send through HealthVault, and to send you service notifications, such as email notifications that information is available to add to your HealthVault records.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealthVault periodically sends newsletters to help keep you informed of the latest improvements. HealthVault will also periodically send you an email summarizing recent account activity. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nMSN\\r\\nMSN services include websites and a suite of apps, including MSN News, Weather, Sports, and Money, and previous versions of the apps branded as Bing (together, \"MSN Apps\"). The MSN Apps are available on various platforms, including Windows, iOS, and Android. MSN services are also included within other Microsoft services, including the Microsoft Edge browser. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you install MSN Apps, we collect data that tells us if the app was installed properly, the installation date, the app version, and other data about your device such as the operating system and browser. This data is collected on a regular basis to help us determine the number of MSN App users and identify performance issues associated with different app versions, operating systems, and browsers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also collect data about how you interact with MSN services, such as usage frequency and content viewed. Some MSN services provide an enhanced experience when you sign in with your Microsoft account, including allowing you to customize your interests and favorites. You can manage personalization through MSN and Bing settings, as well as through settings in other Microsoft services that include MSN services. We also use the data we collect to provide you with advertisements that may be of interest to you. You can opt out of interest-based advertising through the advertising links within MSN services, or by visiting Microsoft\\'s opt-out page.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious versions of MSN Money allow you to access personal finance information from third-party financial institutions. MSN Money only displays this information and does not store it on our servers. Your log-in credentials used to access your financial information from third parties are encrypted on your device and are not sent to Microsoft. These financial institutions, as well as any other third-party services you access through MSN services, are subject to their own terms and privacy policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nOffice\\r\\nOffice is a collection of productivity applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook among others. Various Office applications enable you to use content and functionality from other Microsoft and third-party connected services such as Bing. For detailed information about how to manage your privacy options, please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=624445. If you work in an organization, your administrator can turn off connected services via Group Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nOffice Services\\r\\nOffice Roaming Service. The Office Roaming Service helps keep your Office settings up-to-date across your devices running Office. When you sign into Office with your Microsoft account, the Office Roaming Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Office settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document). When you sign into Office on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. The Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Office settings when you sign into Office.com. When you sign out of Office, the Office Roaming Service removes your Office settings from your device. Any changes you made to your customized Office settings are sent to Microsoft servers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Updates. Office uses the Microsoft Update service to provide you with security and other important updates. See the Update Services section of this privacy statement for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline Help, templates, fonts, and other content. Office uses other Microsoft or third-party services to give you the latest online content when you are connected to the Internet such as Help articles, templates, and fonts. For example, when you use the Help feature in Office applications, Office sends your search query to Office.com to provide you with online Help articles. These features are turned on by default, but you can turn them off using privacy settings. You can access privacy settings in Office 2013 by clicking File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Privacy Options.\\r\\n\\r\\nClick-to-Run Update Service. The Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft Office products over the Internet so you can start using them before they are completely downloaded. By default, the Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them automatically. The service is turned on by default, but you can turn it off by using privacy settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSearch services. Office-supported search services such as Insights allow you to request information from Microsoft or third-party services from within an Office application. For example, in Word, you can highlight a word or phrase and retrieve relevant information from Bing search. When you search on a particular word or phrase, Office sends to the service the encrypted text you requested (and when using Insights, in order to provide you with contextually relevant search results, Office will send your requested word or phrase and some surrounding content from your document). In Excel, you can send categories of data to Microsoft in order to receive recommendations for other sets of similar data that might interest you, but the actual content from your workbook isn\\'t sent to Microsoft. In addition, Office will send data about the software you\\'re using and the locale to which your system is set. If required by a third-party content provider, it will also send authorization data indicating you have the right to download the relevant content. Frequently, the information you receive includes a link to additional information from the content provider\\'s website. If you click the link, the content provider may place a cookie on your device to identify you for future transactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslation service. Some Office applications allow you to translate some or all of your document by using a bilingual dictionary or a machine translation. If a word or phrase you want to translate isn\\'t in the bilingual dictionary included with your application software, the word or phrase is sent unencrypted to a Microsoft or a third-party translation service. If you choose to translate your entire document, the entire document is sent unencrypted to a Microsoft or a third-party translation service. In addition to the word or phrase you want to translate, Office sends information about the Office software you are using, including the version, operating system, and locale and language to which your system is set. For third-party translation services, Office might also send previously stored authentication information indicating that you previously signed up for access to the website.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nOutlook\\r\\nOutlook automatic account configuration. Outlook provides you with an option to automatically configure your mailbox with some email providers to send and receive email messages to and from their servers. To automatically configure your Exchange account, you must provide your email address. Your user name and password will be requested and sent over the Internet to the email provider\\'s server. Outlook will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your Exchange account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple accounts. You can use multiple accounts with Outlook by clicking \"Add Account\" from the File tab. These accounts store your email separately.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutlook Search. Outlook Search provides you with the ability to quickly search through items in your mailbox. Outlook creates a file that includes some of your Outlook data, such as email, folders, and address book contacts. The search function uses the operating system to index this file for searching.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nOneDrive\\r\\nOneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization\\'s use of Office 365.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store in order to provide, improve and protect the services. Examples include, indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the Internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you share content to a social network like Facebook from a phone that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that network or a link to that content is posted to that network. Content posted to social networks and hosted on OneDrive is accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network and from OneDrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign into your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiles managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Office 365 service.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nOutlook.com\\r\\nOutlook.com is Microsoft\\'s primary consumer email service, and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com. Outlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks. You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeleting Email and other items. When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in the Outlook.com web service, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first. When the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nSilverlight\\r\\nMicrosoft Silverlight helps you to access and enjoy rich content on the Web. Silverlight enables websites and services to store data on your device. Other Silverlight features involve connecting to Microsoft to obtain updates, or to Microsoft or third-party servers to play protected digital content.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverlight Configuration tool. You can make choices about these features in the Silverlight Configuration tool. To access the Silverlight Configuration tool, right click on content that is currently being displayed by Silverlight and select Silverlight. You can also run the Silverlight Configuration tool directly. In Windows 10, for example, you can access the tool by searching for \"Microsoft Silverlight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverlight application storage. Silverlight-based applications can store data files locally on your computer for a variety of purposes, including saving your custom settings, storing large files for graphically intensive features (such as games, maps, and images), and storing content that you create within certain applications. You can turn off or configure application storage in the Silverlight Configuration tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverlight updates. Silverlight will periodically check a Microsoft server for updates to provide you with the latest features and improvements. A small file containing information about the latest Silverlight version will be downloaded to your computer and compared to your currently installed version. If a newer version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer. You can turn off or configure updates in the Silverlight Configuration tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigital Rights Management. Silverlight uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to help protect the rights of content owners. If you access DRM-protected content (such as music or video) with Silverlight, it will request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet. In order to provide a seamless playback experience, you will not be prompted before Silverlight sends the request to the rights server. When requesting media usage rights, Silverlight will provide the rights server with an ID for the DRM-protected content file and basic data about your device, including data about the DRM components on your device such as their revision and security levels, and a unique identifier for your device.\\r\\n\\r\\nDRM updates. In some cases, accessing DRM-protected content will require an update to Silverlight or to the DRM components on your device. When you attempt to play content that requires a DRM update, Silverlight will send a request to a Microsoft server containing basic data about your device, including information about the DRM components on your computer such as their revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier for your device. The Microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique DRM update for your device, which will then be installed by Silverlight. You can turn off or configure DRM component updates on the Playback tab in the Silverlight Configuration tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nSkype\\r\\nSkype lets you send and receive voice, video and instant message communications. Both Microsoft Corporation and Skype Communications S.\\xe0.r.l. (a wholly-owned Microsoft subsidiary based in Luxembourg) are data controllers for Skype, and references to Microsoft in this section refer to both legal entities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of providing these features, Microsoft collects usage data about your communications that includes the time and date of the communication and the numbers or usernames that are part of the communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkype profile. To enable other people to find you on Skype (or products that interact with Skype, such as Skype for Business), depending on your profile settings, your Skype profile is included in the search directory. Your profile includes your username, avatar, and any other data you choose to add to your profile or display to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartner companies. To make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companies\\x92 services. If you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that company\\x92s privacy policy governs how it handles your data. To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, disclose and preserve your data. That data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails or file transfers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkype Manager. Skype Manager lets you manage a group\\x92s (such as your family\\x92s) Skype usage from one central place. When you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access. If you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it. Members of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager on their account page at www.skype.com.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkype marketing affiliate program. So that more people can learn about Skype, we encourage other companies and organizations to sign up as marketing affiliates to refer people to Skype. When the people they refer do things like buy Skype Credit, we pay them. We partner with another company, Conversant Media, to operate our affiliate network. Microsoft, our network partner, and the marketing affiliates use cookies and web beacons so we can know which marketing affiliate made a successful referral and earned a payment. Microsoft doesn\\x92t control the cookies that the marketing affiliates set. For more information on the privacy practices of our network partner, visit http://www.conversantmedia.com/legal/privacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPush notifications. To let you know of incoming calls, chats and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by a another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by company providing the notification service. If you don\\x92t want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkype advertising. Some Skype software includes interest-based advertising, so that you\\x92re more likely to see ads you\\x92ll like. In some versions of the software, you can opt out of interest-based advertising in the privacy options or account settings menu. If you sign in to Skype with a Microsoft account, you can opt out of interest-based advertising at http://choice.microsoft.com. If you opt out, you\\x92ll still see ads displayed in the Skype software based on your country of residence, language preference, and IP address location, but other data is not used for ad targeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslation features. To help you communicate with people in different languages, some Skype apps offer audio and/or text translation features. When you use translation features, your voice and text data are used to provide and improve Microsoft speech recognition and translation services.\\r\\n\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWindows\\r\\nWindows 10 (\"Windows\") is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it.  Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to control device settings, device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device. For more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529552.\\r\\nView Summary\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nActivation\\r\\nWhen you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed. The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to confirm your valid license to the software. This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nAdvertising ID\\r\\nWindows generates a unique advertising ID for each user on a device. Your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising. You can turn off access to this identifier at any time in the device Settings. If you choose to turn it on again, a new identifier will be generated. For more information on our use of data for advertising, see the How We Use Data section of this statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nInput Personalization\\r\\nMicrosoft collects and uses data about your speech, inking (handwriting), and typing on Windows devices to help improve and personalize our ability to correctly recognize your input.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, to provide personalized speech recognition, we collect your voice input, as well your name and nickname, your recent calendar events and the names of the people in your appointments, and information about your contacts including names and nicknames. This additional data enables us to better recognize people and events when you dictate messages or documents.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you a personalized user dictionary, help you type and write on your device with better character recognition, and provide you with text suggestions as you type or write. Typing data includes a sample of characters and words you type, which we scrub to remove IDs, IP addresses, and other potential identifiers.  It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text as well as words you\\'ve added to the dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can turn off Input Personalization at any time. This will stop the data collection for this feature and will delete associated data stored on your device, such as your local user dictionary and your input history. As Cortana uses this data to help understand your input, turning off Input Personalization will also disable Cortana on your device. At https://www.bing.com/account/personalization, you can also sign in with your personal Microsoft account and clear data sent to Microsoft, such as your contacts and calendar data, user dictionary, as well as search and browsing history if your device also had Cortana enabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nLocation Services & Motion Sensing\\r\\nWindows location service. Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, location is determined using satellite global positioning service (GPS), detecting nearby cell towers and/or Wi-Fi access points and comparing that information against a database that Microsoft maintains of cell towers and Wi-Fi access points whose location is known, or deriving location from your IP address. When the location service is active on a Windows device, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. Microsoft may also share de-identified location data with third parties to provide and improve location and mapping services.\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), applications running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the Windows location service to determine location if you allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the location service. For information about certain Windows apps that use the location service, see the Windows Apps section below.\\r\\n\\r\\nData about a Windows device\\'s recent location history is stored on the device, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history. You can clear your device\\'s location history at any time in the device\\'s Settings menu.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Settings, you can also view which applications have access to the location service or your device\\'s location history, turn off or on access to the location service for particular applications, or turn off the location service. Note that on mobile devices, your mobile operator will have access to your location even if you turn off the location service.\\r\\n\\r\\nFind My Phone. The Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from https://account.microsoft.com, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone. If you have turned on the \"save my location every few hours\" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone. Each time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.\\r\\n\\r\\nFind My Device. The Find My Device feature allows an administrator of a Windows PC or tablet to find the location of that device if the administrator has enabled the location service for the device, even if other users have disabled location for themselves. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification center.\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows Motion Sensing. Windows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity. This data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn. This data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecording. Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication. This includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance. Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings. \\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nSecurity and Safety Features\\r\\nDevice encryption. Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn\\'t use your individual recovery keys for any purpose. \\r\\n\\r\\nMalicious Software Removal Tool. The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT\\'s reporting component.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Family. Parents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. There are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child\\'s activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmartScreen. SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device. When checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file\\'s contents, and the file\\'s digital certificates. If SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file. When checking web content, data about the content is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content.

Windows Defender looks for malware and other unwanted software on your device. Windows Defender is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Windows Defender is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device and will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, and it may also send files that could contain malware. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically and you\\'ll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Windows Defender not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nSync Settings\\r\\nWhen you sign into Windows with a Microsoft account, Windows syncs some of your settings and data with Microsoft servers to make it easier to have personalized experiences across multiple devices. After you\\'ve signed into one or more devices with a Microsoft account, when you sign into another with the same Microsoft account for the first time, Windows will download and apply the settings and data you choose to sync from your other devices. Settings you choose to sync will automatically update on Microsoft servers and your other devices as you use them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the settings that are synced include:\\r\\n\\r\\nApps you\\'ve installed from the Windows Store\\r\\nLanguage preferences\\r\\nEase of Access preferences\\r\\nPersonalization settings such as your account picture, background, and mouse settings\\r\\nSettings for Windows Store apps\\r\\nSpell checker dictionaries, input method editor (IME) dictionaries, and personal dictionaries\\r\\nInternet Explorer browser history, favorites, and websites you have open\\r\\nSaved app, website, mobile hotspot, and Wi-Fi network names and passwords\\r\\nAddresses of shared network printers that you\\'ve connected to\\r\\nYou can choose whether to sync your settings, and control what is synced, by going to Sync Settings in the Accounts section of Windows Settings. Some apps have their own, separate sync controls. If you sign into Windows with a work account and you choose to connect that account to your personal Microsoft account, Windows will ask which settings you want to sync before connecting your Microsoft account.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nTelemetry & Error Reporting\\r\\nAs you use Windows, we collect diagnostic and usage data that helps us identify and troubleshoot problems, improve our products and services, and provide you with personalized experiences. This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device\\'s service issues and use patterns. There are three levels of diagnostic and usage data: Full, Enhanced and Basic. You can select which level of diagnostic and usage data to provide, but some diagnostic data is vital to the operation of Windows and cannot be turned off.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Windows setup, opting to \"Send full error and diagnostic reporting to Microsoft\" sets your Diagnostic and usage data setting to Full. If you don\\x92t choose to \"Send full error and diagnostic reporting to Microsoft,\" Diagnostic and usage data collection will be set to Enhanced. You can adjust your Diagnostic and usage data collection level at any time in Settings. We recommend that you select Full for the best Windows experience and the most effective troubleshooting.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasic data is data that is vital to the operation of Windows. This data helps keep Windows and apps secure, up-to-date, and running properly by letting Microsoft know the capabilities of your device, what is installed, and whether Windows is operating correctly. This option also includes basic error reporting back to Microsoft. Basic data includes:\\r\\n\\r\\nConfiguration data, including the manufacturer of your device, model, number of processors, display size and resolution, date, region and language settings, and other data about the capabilities of the device.\\r\\nThe software (including drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers), installed on the device.\\r\\nPerformance and reliability data, such as how quickly programs respond to input, how many problems you experience with an app or device, or how quickly information is sent or received over a network connection.\\r\\nNetwork and connection data, such as the device\\x92s IP address, number of network connections in use, and data about the networks you connect to, such as mobile networks, Bluetooth, and identifiers (BSSID and SSID), connection requirements and speed of Wi-Fi networks you connect to.\\r\\nOther hardware devices connected to the device.\\r\\nEnhanced data includes all Basic data plus data about how you use Windows, including Microsoft and third party software (apps, drivers, etc.) that runs on Windows. This data includes frequently or how long you use certain features or apps, which apps and features you use most often, how often you use Windows Help and Support, and which services you use to sign into apps. This option also lets us collect diagnostic data that includes the memory state of your device when a system or app crash occurs, which may unintentionally include parts of a document you were working on when a problem occurred. If you select this option, we\\'ll also be able to provide you with an enhanced and more personalized Windows experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull data includes all Basic and Enhanced data. It also turns on advanced diagnostic features that can collect additional data from your device, which helps us further troubleshoot and fix problems. When devices experience problems that are difficult to diagnose or replicate with Microsoft\\'s internal testing, Microsoft will randomly select a small number of devices, from those at the Full level and exhibiting the problem, from which to gather all of the data needed to diagnose and fix the problem (including user content that may have triggered the issue). If an error report contains personal data, we won\\x92t use that information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows error reports help Microsoft and Microsoft partners diagnose problems in the software you use and provide solutions. We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as OEMs) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services. They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nUpdate Services\\r\\nUpdate Services for Windows includes Windows Update and Microsoft Update. Windows Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software, such as drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers. Microsoft Update is a service that provides you with software updates for other Microsoft software such as Office.\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows Update automatically downloads Windows software updates to your device. You can configure Windows Update to automatically install these updates as they become available (recommended) or have Windows notify you when a restart is required to finish installing updates. Apps available through the Windows Store are automatically updated through the Store, as described in the Windows Store section below.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWeb Browsers: Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer\\r\\nMicrosoft Edge is Microsoft\\'s new web browser for Windows 10. Internet Explorer, Microsoft\\'s legacy browser, is also available in Windows 10. Whenever you use a web browser to access the Internet, data about your device (\"standard device data\") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device\\'s IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites\\' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary Internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew features in Microsoft Edge allow you to capture and save content on your device, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nWeb Note: which allows you to create ink and text annotations on the web pages you visit, and clip, save or share them;\\r\\nActive Reading: which allows you to create and manage reading lists including websites or documents; and\\r\\nHub: which allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area.\\r\\nSome Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites and reading lists. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to Sync Settings in the Accounts section of Windows Settings (see Sync Settings). You can also disable syncing of Microsoft Edge browser information by turning off the sync option in Microsoft Edge Settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Edge and Internet Explorer use your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search results. These features include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAutoSearch and Search Suggestions in Internet Explorer automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to your default search provider (such as Bing) and offer search recommendations as you type each character. In Microsoft Edge, this feature automatically sends this information to Bing even if you have selected another default search provider.\\r\\nPage Prediction sends your browsing history to Microsoft and uses aggregated browsing history data to predict which pages you are likely to browse to next and proactively loads those pages in the background for a faster browsing experience.\\r\\nSuggested Sites recommends web contents that you might be interested in based on your search and browsing history. \\r\\nBrowsing data collected in connection with these features is used in the aggregate and you can turn off any of these features at any time. These features will not collect browsing history while you have InPrivate Browsing enabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer send your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider. If Bing is your default search provider, we use this data as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nCortana can assist you with your web browsing in Microsoft Edge. If enabled, Cortana will collect your search queries and full browsing history, associated with a user ID. Cortana and related Microsoft services will use this data to learn about you and provide you with timely and intelligent answers and proactive personalized suggestions, or to complete web tasks for you. You can disable Cortana for Microsoft Edge web browsing at any time in Microsoft Edge Settings. To learn more about how Cortana uses data and how you can control that, go to the Cortana section of this privacy statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWi-Fi Sense\\r\\nWi-Fi Sense allows you to automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks around you to help you save cellular data and give you more connection options. If you turn it on, you will automatically connect to open Wi-Fi networks. You will also be able to exchange access to password-protected Wi-Fi networks with your contacts. Please note that not all open networks are secure - be careful using an open network to do something online that requires sensitive or personal data, such as making a banking transaction or a purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWindows Apps\\r\\nA number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in the Windows Store. Some of those apps include:\\r\\n\\r\\nMaps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. Please see the Bing section of this privacy statement to learn more about these Bing-powered experiences. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft\\'s services. You can disable the Maps app\\'s access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app\\'s access to the location service.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you\\'re signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). See Sync Settings above for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nCamera and Photo apps. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. You can disable the Camera app\\'s access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device\\'s Settings menu or turning off the Camera app\\'s access to the location service.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour photos, videos, as well as screenshots, saved in your camera roll automatically upload to OneDrive. You can manage your photos and/or videos in OneDrive, and you can disable the automatic upload in Settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you take photos embedded with your location, the Photos app can group your photos by time and location. To group your photos, the Photos app sends location data in your photos to Microsoft to determine the names of locations, such as \"Seattle, Washington\". When you are using the Photo app while signed into your Microsoft account, your photos and videos from OneDrive will be automatically sorted in into albums in the Photo app, and will also appear on the Photo app\\'s live tile. Your photos and/or videos will only be shared with others if you choose to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMessaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages from storage, you must delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location Services section.\\r\\n\\r\\nWallet. Wallet can hold information such as coupons, loyalty cards, tickets, and other digital content. Apps on your mobile device can automatically save information to your Wallet, and you can also add details from an email or web link. Wallet will only share data with the third parties you choose, such as when you make a purchase or submit feedback, but it does not share your location with any third party. Some items in your Wallet can be updated over time, and Wallet will periodically download updates to those items when they\\'re available.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWindows Hello\\r\\nWindows Hello provides instant access to your devices through biometric authentication.  If you turn it on, Windows Hello uses your face, fingerprint or iris to identify you based on a set of unique points or features that are extracted from the image and stored on your device as a template - but it does not store the actual picture or image of your face or iris. Biometric verification data that\\'s used when you sign in doesn\\'t leave your device. You can delete your biometric verification data from within Settings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWindows Search\\r\\nWindows Search lets you search your stuff and the web from one place. If you choose to use Windows Search to search \"your stuff\", it will provide results for items on your OneDrive as well as on your device. If you choose to use Windows Search to search the web, or get search suggestions with Windows Search or Cortana, your search results will be powered by Bing and we will use your search query as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nWindows Store\\r\\nThe Windows Store lets you find, purchase, install, and review apps, music, video, and other content for your Windows devices. You must sign in with a Microsoft account to use the Store. In addition to telemetry data we collect about how you access and use the Store, we collect data about the apps you\\'ve viewed and installed, the preferences you set for viewing apps in the Store, and any ratings, reviews or problem reports you submit. Your Microsoft account is associated with your ratings and reviews; if you write a review, the name and picture from your Microsoft account will be published with your review.\\r\\n\\r\\nPermission for Store apps. Many apps you install from the Windows Store are designed to take advantage of specific hardware and software features of your device. An app\\'s use of certain hardware and software features may give the app or its related service access to your data. For example, a photo editing app might access your device\\'s camera to let you take a new photo or access photos or videos stored on your device for editing, and a restaurant guide might use your location to provide nearby recommendations. Information about the features that an app uses is provided on the app\\'s product description page in the Store. You can review a list of features that apps may use, along with information about which features will prompt for your consent before an app can access them and which features can be turned on and off (either for specific Store apps or all Store apps) through your device\\'s Settings, at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529552.\\r\\n\\r\\nApp updates. Unless you have turned off automatic app updates in the Windows Store Settings, the Windows Store will automatically check for, download, and install app updates to ensure that you have the latest versions. Updated apps might use different Windows hardware and software features from the previous versions, which could give them access to different data on your device. You will be prompted for consent if an updated app accesses certain features, such as location. You can also review the hardware and software features an app uses by viewing its product description page in the Windows Store; and you can control the use of certain features by Store apps through your device\\'s Settings, as described at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529552.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach app\\'s use of your data collected through any of these features is subject to the app developer\\'s privacy policies. If an app available through the Windows Store collects and uses any of your personal data, the app developer is required to provide a privacy policy, and a link to the privacy policy is available on the app\\'s product description page in the Store.\\r\\n\\r\\nSideloaded apps and developer mode. Developer features such as the \"developer mode\" setting are intended for development use only. If you enable developer features, your device may become unreliable or unusable, and expose you to security risks. Downloading or otherwise acquiring apps from sources other than the Store, also known as \"sideloading\" apps, may make your device and personal data more vulnerable to attack or unexpected use by apps. Windows 10 policies, notifications, permissions and other features intended to help protect your privacy when apps access your data may not function as described in this statement for sideloaded apps or when developer features are enabled. \\r\\n\\r\\nTop of page\\r\\nXbox\\r\\nXbox consoles are hardware devices that you can use to access and play games, movies, music, and other forms of digital entertainment. Xbox Live (including Games for Windows Live) is Microsoft\\'s online gaming and entertainment service and social network. It provides ways for you to connect with your friends on Xbox Live and other gaming and social networks. Xbox services can be accessed from a variety of devices, including Xbox consoles, PCs (including via xbox.com and the Xbox app), and mobile devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect data about your use of Xbox services, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you sign in and sign out, the games you play, your game and score statistics, and the purchases you make and content you obtain.\\r\\nPerformance data about the Xbox services, your device and your network connection, including any hardware or software errors that occur.\\r\\nIf you use the Xbox console with Kinect, data about how you use Kinect. See below for more information about Kinect data collection.\\r\\nAll such data is stored with the Xbox console\\'s unique identifier and associated with your personal data. When your Xbox is connected to the Internet, we identify which console and which version of the Xbox operating system you are currently using.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith your consent, we will collect information about videos you purchase or view through third-party apps on your Xbox console. If you use the Xbox TV app, we collect TV viewing history from your console in a way that doesn\\'t identify you or others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you use an Xbox console that includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), and if you play offline or have never signed into the services on the console, usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign into the services.\\r\\n\\r\\nXbox Live data viewable by other users. Your gamertag (Xbox live nickname), game and score statistics, achievements, presence (whether you\\'re signed into Xbox Live), and other data about your activity on Xbox Live can be seen by other users on Xbox Live or other properties associated with Xbox Live (including those of partner companies). For example, your gamertag and scores that show on game leaderboards are considered public and can\\'t be hidden. For other types of data, you can adjust your privacy settings on the console or at xbox.com to limit or block the sharing with other users.\\r\\n\\r\\nXbox Live data shared with game or app publishers. When you use an Xbox Live-enabled game or app, the publisher or service provider for that game or app has access to data about your usage of Xbox Live and that game or app, and may disclose or display (such as on leaderboards) such data. This data includes, for example, your game scores, data about your game play sessions (for example, types of vehicles used in the game), your presence on Xbox Live, the time you spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, and other content that you may create or submit within the game or app.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinking your Xbox Live account to non-Microsoft accounts. Some of the games or apps found on Xbox Live are delivered by partner companies, which may require that you create a non-Microsoft account and sign-in credentials to use that game or app. If you choose to link your Microsoft account with your account with a partner company, Microsoft will share limited account information with that company. Such account information can include name, address, email and date of birth but will not include any credit card or other payment information. For games that enable in-game communications, the game publisher will also have access to the content of in-game communications when you are signed into your account with the publisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nKinect. The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control gameplay and to navigate through the service. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you choose, the camera can be used to sign you into the service automatically using facial recognition. To do this it takes an image of your face and measures distances between key points to create and store a numeric value that represents only you. This data stays on the console and is not shared with anyone, and you can choose to delete this data from your console at any time.\\r\\nFor gameplay, Kinect will map distances between your body\\'s joints to create a stick figure representation of you that helps Kinect enable gameplay. If you are playing online, we collect those numeric values to enable and improve gameplay and the gaming experience. Kinect also detects specific hand gestures intended to do simple system interactions (such as menu navigation, pan/zoom and scroll).\\r\\nFor some fitness games, Xbox can use the Kinect sensor to estimate your exercise data, including estimates such as your heart rate during a certain activity or the number of calories burned during a workout.\\r\\nKinect\\'s microphones enable voice chat between players during gameplay. They also enable voice commands for control of the console, game or app, or to enter search terms. See below for additional details on voice data collection.\\r\\nThe Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as Skype.\\r\\nTo learn more about Kinect, please visit the Kinect FAQ.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunications monitoring. Xbox Live includes communications features such as text-based messaging and online voice chat between players during gameplay.

We collect, and use for service improvement, voice search requests or samples of voice commands occurring while using Kinect. These data are stored separately from your Xbox profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nGameDVR. Any player in a multiplayer game session can use GameDVR to record their view of the gameplay taking place in that session. The recording can capture your in-game character and gamertag in the game clips created by other players in the gameplay session. Note that if a player uses GameDVR on a PC, audio chat may also be captured in a game clip. Microsoft can review game clips for violations of the Microsoft Code of Conduct, even if your game clip sharing setting is set to Block.\\r\\n\\r\\nXbox Live Rewards. Xbox Live Rewards, available at rewards.xbox.com, is a program you can join to receive Xbox credits for being active on the services. You must agree to receive promotional communications from the Rewards program as a condition of joining.

Additional information on the choices available to you for the use of your information for advertising purposes can be found in the \"How to limit the sharing and use of your information\" section below. View information about \"cookies\" and related technologies\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation you provide\\r\\nWhen you contact us for information about products and services or when you enter a Verizon-sponsored or affiliated contest, sweepstakes or promotion, we may use the information you supply to provide you with information about Verizon services, programs and offerings.

We use this information only for the purpose for which you provide it.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerizon may send you emails that communicate information about your account or about products, services, marketing offers or promotions that may be of interest to you. When you open a Verizon email or click on links within these emails, we may collect and retain information to provide you with future communications that may be more interesting to you. Please note that Verizon will not ask you to send us, via email, sensitive personal or account information.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional information for Verizon Wireless customers\\r\\nVerizon Wireless inserts a unique identifier in certain web traffic from your mobile device. The identifier is used to identify eligible mobile device (through both the Relevant Mobile Advertising and Selects advertising programs) and to deliver other services. If you opt out of the Relevant Mobile Advertising program and you have not joined Verizon Selects, or if you activate certain types of lines that are not eligible to participate in our advertising programs, Verizon Wireless will stop inserting the Unique Identifier Header (UIDH). The identifier will continue to appear for a short period of time while we are updating our systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerizon Wireless collects and uses mobile device location data for a variety of purposes, including to provide our mobile voice and data services, emergency services, and our and third-party location-based apps and services such as navigation, weather, mapping and child safety apps or tools. Verizon apps that use location information provide choices about the use of this information.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany types of wireless apps and services use mobile device location data, including apps provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new apps or services, you should carefully review the location-based services\\' or app providers\\' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerizon-supplied system application software may be present on your wireless device to enable automatic installation of apps when you activate your device and with your consent at later times. This software will collect certain usage information about the apps it installs, including first open and uninstall events. You can delete or disable these apps at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerizon Wireless does not publish directories of our customers\\' wireless phone numbers, and we do not provide or make them available to third parties for listing in directories unless you request that we do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about the Cable Act\\r\\nTo the extent that Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Cable Act\") applies to services you purchase, it entitles you to know about the personally identifiable information a cable service provider collects. This includes the nature of the use and disclosure of this information and to whom it may be disclosed, how long personally identifiable information is maintained, and how subscribers may access it. In addition, the Cable Act imposes limits on the collection and disclosure of personal information and gives subscribers the ability to enforce their privacy rights. (Personally identifiable information does not include aggregate data that does not identify a particular person).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cable Act allows a provider to use its cable system to collect personally identifiable information necessary to render a cable service or other services provided to subscribers and to detect and prevent unauthorized access to services. Additional personally identifiable information may be collected with the subscriber\\x92s prior consent. Personally identifiable information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber\\x92s consent where necessary to render services, and to conduct legitimate business activities related to services provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information to a governmental entity to comply with valid legal process, such as warrants, court orders or subpoenas, but we will not disclose records revealing your selection of video programming unless we receive a court order indicating that the governmental entity has made a specified showing of relevance and you were afforded an opportunity to contest the order. We may be required to disclose personally identifiable information (including your selection of video programming) to a non-governmental entity to comply with a court order, after you have been provided notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you believe that your privacy rights have been violated, please e-mail us and we will work with you to address your concerns. If you believe that you have been aggrieved as a result of a violation of the Cable Act, you may enforce the limitations imposed by the Cable Act through a civil action in a United States district court seeking damages, attorney\\'s fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may also be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cable Act permits the disclosure of customer names and addresses as long as a subscriber has been provided with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this disclosure and the disclosure does not reveal, directly or indirectly, the subscriber\\x92s viewing or other uses of the cable or other services provided. If we intend to share data in this way, we will provide you with the opportunity to prohibit or limit this type of sharing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional Information for hum service\\r\\nhum service includes vehicle diagnostics, vehicle location assistance, one-button emergency calling, automated alerts to emergency personnel when a potential accident is detected, and roadside assistance services as well as possible discounts on travel, automotive, car rental and other offers. When installed in your car, the hum system collects information about your vehicle\\'s performance and maintenance characteristics, as well as vehicle location and use information (including trip distances, acceleration, deceleration, turning, speed and revolutions per minute). In addition to other uses described in this policy, this information will be used to develop and provide a driving tips feature planned for introduction in 2016. This feature is expected to rate your overall driving and suggest ways in which driving could potentially be improved.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation that identifies your vehicle and other personal information may be shared as described in the information sharing sections of this policy as well as when it is necessary to provide various hum service features, such as alerting emergency personnel of your location if a crash is detected, helping authorities locate your vehicle if you report it stolen or helping roadside assistance locate your vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nhum information may also be used on its own or in combination with other Verizon information to determine aggregate insights about hum users.  For example, a company may find it valuable to know the number of vehicles on different roads at various times during the day and the percent of drivers of those vehicles that are in a certain age range.  hum information may also be shared with third parties in a way that does not identify you personally.  For example, it may be used  to provide traffic reporting and similar services or to inform car manufacturers about characteristics of different vehicle models.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising and insight programs\\r\\nRelevant Mobile Advertising Program\\r\\nBeginning in November 2015, the Verizon Wireless Relevant Mobile Advertising program will be combined into the AOL Advertising Network to help make marketing you see more personalized and useful to you across the devices and services you use.\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe Relevant Mobile Advertising program uses your postal and email addresses; certain information about your Verizon Wireless products and services such as your device type; and demographic and interest categories we get from other companies such as your gender, age range and interests (i.e. sports fan, frequent diner or pet owner). The AOL Advertising Network uses information collected when you use AOL services and visit third-party websites where AOL provides advertising services (such as web browsing, app usage and location), as well as information that AOL obtains from third-party partners and advertisers. The combined advertising program will use online and device identifiers including AOL browser cookies, advertising IDs from Apple and Google, and one created by Verizon, known as a Unique Identifier Header or UIDH. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not share information that identifies you personally as part of these programs other than with vendors and partners who do work for us. We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us. You have a choice about participating in this program.\\r\\nBusiness and Marketing Insights\\r\\nVerizon Wireless uses certain customer information to create aggregate business and marketing insights. The program uses Information about how you use your mobile device, including web browsing, apps and features you use and the location of your device, as well as certain information about your Verizon products and services (such as device type and amount of use) and information we obtain from other companies (such as gender, age range and interests). We may combine this information in a manner that does not personally identify you and use it to prepare aggregated business and marketing insight that we may use ourselves or share with others for their use. We may also share location information with others in a way that does not personally identify you so that they may produce aggregate business and marketing reports. You have a choice about whether your information is included in these reports.\\r\\nRelevant Online Advertising\\r\\nThe Relevant Online Advertising program helps advertisers better reach our wireline Internet access customers using the postal address we have for you; certain information about your Verizon products and services \\x96 such as device type and broadband service features; and demographic and interest information provided to us by other companies \\x96 such as gender, age-range, sports fan, frequent diner or pet owner. This information is used to predict whether you fit within an audience an advertiser is trying to reach. We do not share information that identifies you personally as part of these programs other than with vendors and partners who do work for us. We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us. You have a choice about participating in this program.\\r\\nRelevant TV Advertising\\r\\nVerizon\\x92s Relevant TV Advertising program helps advertisers reach Fios television customers with advertisements that may be more relevant to their interests. We do not share information that identifies you personally as part of these programs other than with vendors and partners who do work for us. We require that these vendors and partners protect the information and use it only for the services they are providing us. The ads may appear on a variety of platforms where Fios television customers can access video content.

By using this Site, you agree to accept the terms provided.\\n\\nOther than as described in this Policy, we will not give any information about you to others without your express permission.\\n\\nInformation Collection and Use\\n\\nAlthough this Site is primarily for informational purposes, we may ask you to provide us with your name, email address or other information that could be used to identify you personally.  For example, we may collect this information in the event that you register as a member of this Site, post a comment, sign-up to receive email communications, or submit demographic information as part of a survey.\\n\\nWe receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications.

We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our Site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.\\n\\nOur Site uses cookies to enhance your experience with our Site.  Cookies are data files that are placed in your browser to keep track of your personal preferences and to facilitate easy navigation through our Site.  We use cookies to identify you so you don\\'t need to log in each time you visit our Site.  You may opt-out of the use of cookies by altering settings on your browser.  Please note, however, that some areas of the Site will be easier to navigate with the use of cookies..\\n\\nThis Site also contains links to other websites. Unfortunately, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nThis Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.  We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\\n\\nUpdating Your Information\\n\\nYou may alter your account information or opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners at any time. We have the following options for changing and modifying your account information or contact preferences.\\n\\n        i.      You may send an email to support@godaddy.com\\n\\n       ii.

We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN\\'s rules, regulations and policies.\\n\\nThird Party Service Providers\\n\\nWe may at times provide information about you to third parties to provide various services on our behalf, such as serving advertisements, conducting contests or surveys, performing analyses of our user demographics, shipping of goods or services, and user relationship management. We will only share information about you that is necessary for the third party to provide the requested service. These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.\\n\\nIn the event that we use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf, these companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel GIF or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here.\\n\\nSupplementation of Information\\n\\nIn order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources (e.g., information from our strategic partners, service providers, or the United States Postal Service).  We do this to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our products and services to you, and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.\\n\\nContests/Surveys\\n\\nFrom time-to-time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you choose to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level - note that you must be 18 or above to enter). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic, and to personalize our Site.\\n\\nWe may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests. When we do, that company will be prohibited from using our users\\' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.\\n\\nTell-A-Friend\\n\\nIf a user elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our Site, we ask the user for the friend\\'s name and email address. Go Daddy will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our Site. Go Daddy stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Go Daddy at support@godaddy.com to request the removal of this information from our database.\\n\\nWhat Happens to my Personal Information if I Opt Out?\\n\\nIf you advise us that you wish to opt out of receiving further communications from us, we will place your personally identifiable information in \"deactivated\" status on our relevant databases. However, you should know that placement of your information in \"deactivated\" status does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information as necessary in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\\n\\nTransfer of Data Abroad\\n\\nIf you are visiting this Site from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.

Viewpoint makes no representations whatsoever about any other web site to which you may have access through the Viewpoint web site. Access of a non-Viewpoint web site is done at your own risk and Viewpoint is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, data, opinions, advice, or statements made on these sites. Viewpoint provides these links merely as a convenience. The inclusion of such links does not imply that Viewpoint endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content or uses of such web sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nData collection\\r\\n\\r\\n    Viewpoint\\'s software products do not automatically collect any personally identifying information. Our software products do not have the ability to automatically collect or monitor personally-identifiable information. Examples of personally identifiable information include your name, address, email addresses, phone numbers, and passwords.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Viewpoint collects limited anonymous information in connection with its search and advertising products that your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This information includes your browser type, browser language, referrer URL, the date and time of your search query and your operating system. We may use one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our technology and services.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Some of our services may ask you to register for an account and voluntarily submit limited personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address and unique password for your account). We will use that information only to provide the service and will not sell or license your information to 3rd parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    When we ask for your information in connection with services that you register for, we will always inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer\\'s name. We do obtain the customer\\'s consent to post their name along with their testimonial prior to posting the testimonial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdates to Viewpoint Software Products\\r\\n\\r\\nViewpoint\\'s software products each have different updating policies.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies\\r\\n\\r\\n    A \"cookie\" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a particular website. It remains stored on your computer until you delete it. Upon using Viewpoint technology and services, a cookie is put on your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. The cookie does NOT store your name, address, phone number, email address, or anything that personally identifies you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    We use cookies to better understand how people interact with our technology so we can continue to offer improved technology and services. Viewpoint does this by storing user preferences and relevant session data in cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you refuse cookies, some Viewpoint features or services \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as well as features and services provided by many websites and web-based email services \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may not function properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation sharing\\r\\n\\r\\n    Viewpoint\\'s technology products do not have the ability to collect or monitor your name, physical address, email address, phone number or other sensitive and private information such as passwords.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    If we ask you to register for an account in connection with our services, we will request that you provide your name, email address and a password for your account and we will use that information only to provide the service and will not sell or license your information to 3rd parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    We may share aggregated anonymous information with others in general compliance with industry standards. An example of aggregated data that we may share in this way includes the number of times an advertisement has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclicked\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the total number of web surfers who have viewed the page in which the advertisement was displayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nService-related Announcements\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.

If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account on developer.viewpoint.com.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to Personally Identifiable Information\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the personally identifiable information you have entered on the Developer site changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update it by making the change on our developer.viewpoint.com member information page.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinks\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Viewpoint.

Various pages on this website contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Words such as \"expects\", \"intends\", \"plans\", \"projects\", \"believes\", \"estimates\" and similar expressions are used to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, certain presentations available for viewing were created as of the dates indicated on such presentations and ConocoPhillips expressly disclaims any responsibility for updating such presentations.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Forward-looking statements relating to ConocoPhillips\\' operations are based on management\\'s expectations, estimates and projections about ConocoPhillips and the petroleum industry in effect on the date the statements were made. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements, due to a variety of factors, including the economic, business, competitive and regulatory factors affecting our business generally as set forth in Item 1A of our Form 10-K and those mentioned in other reports and filings with the Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").  Copies are available from the SEC and are available on this website.\\r\\n\\r\\nREGARDING RESERVES\\r\\n\\r\\nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors.

Copies are available from the SEC and are available on this website.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRIVACY PLEDGE\\r\\n\\r\\nConocoPhillips is committed to honoring the privacy and security of visitors to websites owned and operated by ConocoPhillips or its affiliates. We collect information to process your transactions and to help us provide a better level of service. We do not sell your information to anyone. We strive to protect the security and confidentiality of the information we collect. We urge you to read the following sections.\\r\\n\\r\\nPERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION\\r\\n\\r\\n1. When you submit a request or electronically pass information to ConocoPhillips (including, but not limited to, completing retail employment applications and credit card applications), you are sometimes asked to provide certain information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, date of birth and email address. In various \"contacts\" pages, we may ask for personally identifiable information in order to facilitate your requests, provide personalized service and communicate separately with you. We do not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information with any third parties outside of ConocoPhillips. However, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a third party that provides services to ConocoPhillips, its affiliates or subsidiaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Because we rely on third-party commercial software and programs to operate our servers, we may inadvertently collect personal information due to certain automatic functions or features contained in such software or due to certain software changes or upgrades. We will use reasonable efforts to remove any such information after we discover such information in our system. \\r\\n\\r\\nCOOKIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cookies\" are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer\\'s hard drive to enable you to more easily communicate and interact with a website. We may use cookies to allow you to use our site more easily and to allow us to keep track of certain statistical information that helps us improve our site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You may, however, disallow reception of cookies at any time by resetting your Web browser. ConocoPhillips will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to the website or your interaction with the website. Our cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.\\r\\n\\r\\nINTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the website. Your Internet Protocol address is used to help identify you for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic information. This information will not be sold to any third party.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLICK STREAM DATA\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes called \"click stream\" data, can be collected and stored by a website\\'s server. Click stream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the website from which you linked to the website. We may use click stream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the website and how they navigate through the website. We will only use this information to improve the website. Any collection or use of click stream data will be anonymous and aggregate and will not contain any personally identifiable information.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONSENT TO PROCESSING\\r\\n\\r\\nBy providing any information to the website, all users fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGAL DISCLOSURE\\r\\n\\r\\nConocoPhillips shall, pursuant to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, allow access to information, including personally identifiable information, provided to the website in order to comply with such process and to protect its rights and property.\\r\\n\\r\\nLINKED SITES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe website may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to the website. ConocoPhillips is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nPARENTAL CONSENT\\r\\n\\r\\nOur website may contain pages that are of interest to children under the age of 18, but we do not seek through this site to gather personal information specifically from or about children under 18. Because our software does not automatically distinguish visitors under 18 from other visitors, ConocoPhillips requires users younger than 18 years of age to obtain the consent of a parent, guardian, teacher or librarian to view the website. You agree to abide by such restrictions and not to help anyone avoid these restrictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHILDREN\\r\\n\\r\\nThe website is not directed nor targeted to children. ConocoPhillips will not knowingly collect information from children. Because our software does not automatically distinguish visitors younger than 18 from other visitors, ConocoPhillips requires users younger than 18 years of age to obtain the consent of a parent, guardian, teacher or librarian to view the website. If ConocoPhillips learns that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the website, it will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.\\r\\n\\r\\nUSER\\'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS POLICY\\r\\n\\r\\nBy visiting the website, you signify your assent to the terms of ConocoPhillips\\' privacy policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not use the website. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions from this privacy policy at any time. Your continued use of the website following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.', b'PRIVACY POLICY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTATEMENT OF PRIVACY ( 12/23/2014, UNITED STATES ONLY)\\r\\nAmerican Honda Motor Co., Inc.

Use of certain features and tools on this Site requires that you provide us with personally identifiable information.  However, you always have the option not to provide personal information by choosing not to use a particular feature.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe may request personally identifiable information in order to enhance your experience on our web sites.  There are instances where American Honda requests personally identifiable information to provide the web site visitor a service or correspondence (such as promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and is used to fulfill your request. The information you provide is used by American Honda to improve the services we provide you and to help us promote products and services that are of most interest to you.

This information is collected and used to generate statistics, measure site activity, and improve the usefulness of our sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of Cookies\\r\\n\\r\\nA \"cookie\" is a small text file or text identifier placed on your computer to assist us in providing customized services.  We use cookies to provide you with a convenience feature to save you time and provide a more personalized experience on our site.  For example, you may log on once during a visit and will be able to access multiple servers without having to log on again and again.  We also use the information for internal research on our user\\'s demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand our visitor\\'s preferences.  We may use cookies provided by third parties, including ClearTrust, BrowserHawk, Capricorn Encryption, and WebTrends e-commerce software.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Some portions of our Web sites, such as owners.honda.com/owners.acura.com, however, require the use of cookies for proper function.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising Campaigns\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of our sites, such as automobiles.honda.com and owners.honda.com/owners.acura.com, use web beacons also called single pixel gifs. Their use helps us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Certain gif files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy. In short, web beacons collect only a limited amount of information including cookies and time and date of viewing and do not contain personally identifiable information. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by going to: http://preferences.truste.com/preference.html?affiliateId=99. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation Use\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information you share with American Honda is used to improve the services we provide you and to provide services to you that you request. For example, if you enroll in EasyPay or Pay Online, our account payment services, we will be required to validate your bank account information with your bank. If you request brochures, we may hire a third party fulfillment company to meet your request. We may share information about you with third party service providers (such as companies who assist us in marketing, conducting surveys and research to help us provide better products and services). However, your information is not shared with or sold to any other third party entity or individual for that entity or individual\\'s independent use with the exception of when you request to be added to the fan mailing list of one of the participating Civic Tour bands and/or Civic Tour promotional partners or in situations where required by law, we may need to share this information with law enforcement officials such as in response to a court order or subpoena. AHFC customers are also encouraged to see the American Honda Finance Corporation Financial Privacy Policy below to learn more about protections and use of your nonpublic personal information (such as personally identifiable financial information).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information you share with American Honda when you apply for employment with American Honda or any of its affiliated companies through our site at http://corporate.honda.com/careers/ may include personal information, such as name, educational and employment background, contact information, job qualifications, and jobs for which you may wish to be considered.  You may choose to provide additional information, such as your resume or CV, employment references, and salary requirements.  You may also choose to provide this information by extracting it from another online location, such as Google, Yahoo, or Talent Exchange Universal Profile.  Your provision of this information in connection with seeking employment at American Honda is voluntary and you determine the extent of the information you provide.  Your decision not to provide such information may affect our ability to consider you for employment.  This information is collected and maintained through Oracle\\x92s Taleo service and is not shared except between the Taleo service and American Honda (and its affiliated companies), or between American Honda and its affiliated companies, as necessary for employment decisions.  For more information about Oracle\\x92s privacy policies, please consult Oracle\\x92s disclosures on its website (www.oracle.com). \\r\\n\\r\\nPartners\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you visit or use a part of any website, landing page or mobile application that is co-branded or that is a part of a joint promotion involving American Honda and one or more third parties (each a \\x93Co-Branded Party\\x94), you are providing and consenting to provide your personal information and any other information collected by any Co-Branded Party to American Honda and each of the Co-Branded Parties without any other notice or further consent.  We do not control Co-Branded Parties\\x92 use or treatment of information you provide to them and you should consult each of their privacy policies or any separate Co-Branded privacy policy posted on or linked from the Co-Branded site to determine your rights with respect to their use and treatment of your information.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Honda has reasonable security measures in place to protect your personally identifiable information.  This information is protected while being transmitted through a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) connection.  Most web pages that display personally identifiable information are encrypted using 128-bit SSL, which is an industry standard.  The following brands\\' brochure requests, however, are not transmitted through a SSL connection:  Engine, Marine, and Power Equipment.  In addition, the Motorcycle brand site does not currently transmit brochure and email notification requests through an SSL connection.  In addition, we have security procedures and policies in place to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, and modification of this information after we receive it.  However, perfect security does not exist over the internet.

However, please be aware that if you access these links you will be leaving our site.  As a result, we encourage users to read the privacy policies of those sites as we are not responsible for their content, links, or privacy procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy Updates\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we decide to change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes to this privacy policy so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We suggest periodically visiting this page to review our policies and procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific Web Site Provisions\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section below addresses this Site\\x92s unique functionality and offerings specific to particular areas of each Site and serves as a supplement to the General Provisions above.', b'Introduction and scope of policy\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Wells Fargo Digital Privacy and Cookies Policy (\\x93Policy\\x94) applies to your interaction with Wells Fargo & Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, \\x93Wells Fargo,\\x94 \\x93we,\\x94 \\x93us,\\x94 \\x93our\\x94), at any online or mobile site or application that we own and control (\\x93Site\\x94), unless a different online and/or mobile policy is posted at a particular site, or is made available to you and by its terms supplants this Policy.

Privacy Policy\\r\\nThis Privacy Policy applies to ING Bank (Australia) Limited (ABN 24 000 893 292) (trading as \"ING DIRECT\\x94). The\\r\\nterms \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\" used in this Policy mean ING DIRECT.\\r\\nING DIRECT is committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of your personal information. We are bound\\r\\nby the Privacy Act 1988, including the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in that Act, to guide us in our\\r\\nresponsible handling of your personal information.\\r\\n2. What personal information do we collect?\\r\\nIn simple terms, personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual\\r\\nwho can reasonably be identified. The type of personal information we collect may include your name, mailing\\r\\naddress, date of birth, email address, telephone number, tax file number, annual income and other financial details.\\r\\n2.1. Credit information\\r\\nIf you are applying for credit or if you are a guarantor, the personal information we will collect includes anything\\r\\nabout credit worthiness, standing, history and capacity, such as your employment details, your financial details,\\r\\nopinions from other credit providers about your credit worthiness and reports and other information from credit\\r\\nreporting bodies.\\r\\nWe derive certain information we receive from credit reporting bodies about you, such as credit ratings or scores,\\r\\nto enable us to make responsible lending decisions.\\r\\n2.2. Sensitive information\\r\\nWe don\\x92t generally collect personal information about you which is sensitive, such as information about your health\\r\\nor criminal record. Unless the collection of sensitive information is required or authorised by law or a court order,\\r\\nwe will obtain your consent to its collection only if we need it to provide you with a specific product or service (such\\r\\nas certain types of insurance), if you make a claim with us for financial hardship relief or if you apply for employment\\r\\nwith us.\\r\\n2.3. Tax File Number\\r\\nING DIRECT is required to request the collection of your Tax File Number (TFN) under certain legislation.\\r\\nThe handling of TFNs is also regulated under the Privacy Act through Guidelines issued by the Information\\r\\nCommissioner.\\r\\nThe continued confidentiality and security of your TFN will be maintained in accordance with these Tax File\\r\\nNumber Guidelines.\\r\\nING DIRECT may also request the collection of a foreign tax identification number in order to comply with global\\r\\nlaws that have extraterritorial application to ING DIRECT or the ING Group.\\r\\n2.4. Dealing with us anonymously or by use of a pseudonym\\r\\nYou can deal with us anonymously or by a pseudonym (e.g. an email address that doesn\\x92t contain your actual name)\\r\\nin some circumstances, such as when you make inquiries about our products and services. However, we\\x92ll need to\\r\\nknow (and verify) who you are before we can provide you with our financial products and services.\\r\\n3. How we collect your personal information\\r\\nWe collect most personal information directly from you. For instance, your personal information will be collected\\r\\nwhen you deal with us via our Contact Centre, send us a letter, visit our websites, when you complete an\\r\\napplication form or open an account. We may also collect your personal information through customer surveys or\\r\\nquestionnaires for the purpose of obtaining your feedback on our products and services.\\r\\nOccasionally, we may need to source personal information about you from a third party, but only if you\\x92ve\\r\\nconsented to us collecting the information in this way or you would reasonably expect us to collect the information\\r\\nabout you from a third party. For instance, we may collect certain personal information about you from credit\\r\\nreporting bodies, government departments or third party brokers.\\r\\n4. How we use your personal information\\r\\nThe general rule is that we will use or disclose your personal information only for the purposes stated at the time of\\r\\nthe collection. If we want to use your personal information for another purpose, we will seek further consent from\\r\\nyou, unless that other purpose is related to one of the original purposes of collection and you would reasonably\\r\\nexpect us to use your personal information for that other purpose.\\r\\nWe collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information for the following reasons:\\r\\n\\x95\\t to assist in providing you with information about an ING DIRECT product or service that you\\x92ve asked us\\r\\nabout;\\r\\n\\x95\\t to assess your application and eligibility for a product or service. In particular, when you apply for credit,\\r\\nwe need to be able to work out whether you\\x92re likely to be in a position to repay. We\\x92ll base this decision\\r\\non your financial position and your credit history from the information that you have provided on your\\r\\napplication form, in conjunction with information from credit reporting bodies and other credit providers\\r\\nthat you\\x92ve dealt with;\\r\\n\\x95\\t to provide you with the products and services that you have requested and generally to administer our\\r\\nrelationship with you;\\r\\n\\x95\\t to assist us to run our business, including using information for training purposes, risk management,\\r\\nsystems development and testing, archiving, record keeping, product and service development,\\r\\nundertaking planning, research and statistical analysis and other operational and administrative tasks;\\r\\n\\x95\\t unless you tell us otherwise, to provide you with further information about other ING DIRECT products and\\r\\nservices and products and services from selected service providers with whom we have a relationship;\\r\\n\\x95\\t to safeguard the security and integrity of the ING Group and the financial sector, including preventing\\r\\nfraud and other criminal or undesirable activities in relation to the ING Group, its customers and staff or\\r\\nother financial institutions; and\\r\\n\\x95\\t to comply with Australian legal and regulatory obligations (including codes of conduct and external\\r\\npayment systems) and global legal or regulatory requirements that have extraterritorial application to ING\\r\\nDIRECT or the ING Group. For example, ING DIRECT has an obligation to identify customers under the\\r\\nAnti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act). We will identify the law\\r\\nor regulation that authorises or requires us to collect your personal information at the time of collection (or\\r\\nas soon as possible after we collect it).\\r\\nIf you do not provide us with the requested information we will generally not be able to provide you with ING\\r\\nDIRECT products or services. You also can refuse to give, or withdraw, your consent in relation to any particular\\r\\nuse of your personal information at any time. However, again, if you refuse to give your consent or withdraw your\\r\\nconsent for particular uses we will not be able to provide you with products or services.\\r\\n5. Disclosure of your personal information to other parties\\r\\nIt may be necessary for ING DIRECT to disclose your personal information to certain third parties in order to\\r\\nassist us in providing, managing and administering your products or services or for other related purposes. These\\r\\ninclude:\\r\\n5.1.\\t Other financial institutions\\r\\nOther financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, building societies and payment services such as VISA, in\\r\\norder to set up and manage your account and manage banking transactions and, at their request, to provide an\\r\\nopinion or information about your credit worthiness, credit standing, credit history or credit capacity if you seek\\r\\ncredit from them.\\r\\n5.2. Other organisations\\r\\nOther entities in the ING Group of companies and third parties, such as:\\r\\n\\x95\\t other ING Group entities in order to service other products you may have within the Group and portfolio\\r\\nanalysis;\\r\\n\\x95\\t other ING Group entities located overseas for account administration, regulatory and security purposes;\\r\\n\\x95\\t any person acting on your behalf including your financial adviser, power of attorney, solicitor or accountant;\\r\\n\\x95\\t your referee(s);\\r\\n\\t your guarantor(s);\\r\\n\\x95\\t any person who introduces you to us, including mortgage intermediaries and agents;\\r\\n\\x95\\t organisations undertaking reviews of the integrity of our operations, including the accuracy and\\r\\ncompleteness of our information;\\r\\n\\x95\\t any third party product and service supplier that we have an arrangement with (so that either us or they\\r\\nmay provide you with the product or service you have requested or in which you have expressed an\\r\\ninterest);\\r\\n\\x95\\t our solicitors, valuers and insurers (for loan products);\\r\\n\\x95\\t credit reporting or information verification agencies (or their affiliated entities) in order to obtain and\\r\\nprovide details about your credit history or status, to verify other information about you including your\\r\\nidentity, to carry out your request to correct your credit information or to resolve your complaint about the\\r\\nhandling, use or disclosure of your credit information;\\r\\n\\x95\\t organisations involved in securitisation arrangements. These organisations include trustees of those\\r\\narrangements, investors and their advisers;\\r\\n\\x95\\t organisations who perform services or functions on our behalf;\\r\\n\\x95\\t organisations undertaking compliance reviews of financial advisers or mortgage intermediaries; and\\r\\n\\x95\\t organisations providing any of trustee, administration, custodial, insurance, broker and share trading and\\r\\nfinancial planning advice services in relation to superannuation.\\r\\nAny example used above to indicate when we might disclose personal information may not be limited to those\\r\\nexamples (or examples of a similar kind).\\r\\n5.3. Other disclosures\\r\\nPersonal information will only be disclosed to third parties other than those listed above:\\r\\n\\x95\\t if you have expressly consented to your personal information being supplied to others, which we will\\r\\nusually obtain from you in writing. We can also ask you to consent verbally in some circumstances;\\r\\n\\x95\\t if you would reasonably expect us to disclose information of that kind to those third parties; or\\r\\n\\x95\\t if we are authorised or required to do so by law or if it is necessary to assist with law enforcement. For\\r\\nexample, a regulator (such as the Australian Taxation Office or the Australian Securities & Investments\\r\\nCommission), a Court or the police can compel us to disclose personal information to them.\\r\\n5.4. Credit reporting bodies\\r\\nWe may disclose information to credit reporting bodies prior, during or after a loan product is provided to you. This\\r\\nincludes:\\r\\n\\x95\\t that you have applied for a loan and the date on which the loan is entered into, the type of loan, the terms\\r\\nand conditions relating to the loan, the amount of the loan and date on which the loan is paid out or\\r\\notherwise discharged;\\r\\n\\x95\\t your repayment history information, which is information about whether you have met your monthly\\r\\npayment obligations (subject to any \\x91grace period\\x92), and if your payment is late \\x96 how late it is;\\r\\n\\x95 \\t subject to our financial hardship process and otherwise providing you with at least 14 days notice, details\\r\\nof payments for no less than $150 that are at least 60 days overdue and which are in collection (and\\r\\nadvice that payments are no longer overdue); and our opinion that you have committed a serious credit\\r\\ninfringement.\\r\\n5.5. Outsourcing\\r\\nWe disclose information when we outsource certain services or functions, including mailing services, document\\r\\nstorage services, direct marketing, data verification services, information technology support and printing our\\r\\nstandard documents and correspondence. Organisations performing services on our behalf are required to comply\\r\\nwith our confidentiality and privacy requirements.\\r\\n5.6. Securitisation\\r\\nSecuritisation involves the bundling of assets of a similar nature (such as loans) and selling those bundled assets to\\r\\nan entity established for this purpose. To complete the transaction, we may disclose personal information to any\\r\\nperson involved in the transaction, such as the purchaser of the bundled assets, rating agencies, trustees, investors\\r\\nand advisors.\\r\\n5.7. Sending information overseas\\r\\nWe may have to send personal information overseas for example, if required to complete a transaction or where we\\r\\noutsource a function to an overseas contractor. Your personal information may be disclosed to staff in ING Group\\r\\nentities in Singapore and the Netherlands if necessary to administer our relationship with you; if those entities\\r\\nprovide services to, or functions for, ING DIRECT; for transactional reasons; or to comply with Australian and global\\r\\nregulatory requirements applying to us or the ING Group (including to comply with requests for information\\r\\nreceived by overseas regulators).\\r\\nWe will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties located overseas do not breach the APPs in relation to\\r\\nyour personal information.\\r\\n6. Marketing\\r\\nWe may use your personal information to offer you products and services that we believe may interest you, but we\\r\\nwon\\x92t if you tell us not to. We do not sell or rent your personal information to any unrelated third parties for their\\r\\nmarketing purposes without your explicit consent.\\r\\nHowever, we may supply your personal information to direct marketing agencies, other ING Group entities,\\r\\nselected affiliated service providers, or any of the service providers in relation to the superannuation fund to which\\r\\nING DIRECT is the promoter (including the trustee) for the sole purpose of those companies contacting you about\\r\\nING DIRECT or ING DIRECT products and services that may be of interest to you.\\r\\nIf you don\\x92t want to receive marketing offers from us about our products and services or those of another ING\\r\\nGroup entity or third party service providers with whom we have a relationship, please let us know by:\\r\\n\\x95\\t ticking the box on the applicable form when you apply for a product or service; or\\r\\n\\x95\\t contacting us by any of the means set out in Section 12 (\\x93How to contact ING DIRECT about privacy\\x94).\\r\\nWe will act promptly on your request and will also ensure that each electronic marketing message sent (e.g.\\r\\nby email) includes a method that enables you to tell us you do not want to receive future electronic marketing\\r\\nmaterial.\\r\\n7. How to access and correct your personal information\\r\\n7.1. Access\\r\\nYou may request access to limited amounts of personal information that we hold about you \\x96 such as your address -\\r\\nby calling us on 133 464.\\r\\nFor a more detailed request for access to information that we hold about you, you will need to write to the ING\\r\\nDIRECT Privacy Officer at GPO Box 4094, Sydney NSW 2001. We may request that you specify the information you\\r\\nwish to access, to help us quickly identify and retrieve that information for you.\\r\\nPlease note that requests for access to your personal information may only be made by you or by another person\\r\\nwho you have authorised to make a request on your behalf, such as a legal guardian or authorised agent. We\\r\\nwill require you to verify your identity, or the identity and authority of your representative, to our reasonable\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\nAn access charge may apply, but not to your request for access itself. In particular, we may impose a reasonable\\r\\ncharge for providing access to this information to recover any expenses incurred in retrieving and collating the\\r\\nrequested information. Please refer to your product documentation or contact ING DIRECT for details of any\\r\\napplicable access charge. Where an access charge applies, unless you authorise us to debit your account with us,\\r\\naccess won\\x92t be provided until we receive payment.\\r\\nWe will respond to your access request as soon as possible and tell you how long it will take to provide the\\r\\ninformation. This will usually be in less than 14 days, but may be up to 28 days in some circumstances.\\r\\nWe may exercise our right to deny access to particular information in certain situations, for example where access\\r\\nmay reveal our commercially sensitive decision processes (e.g, criteria for loan approvals) or where the information\\r\\nrelates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings or where it will threaten the privacy of other individuals.\\r\\nIf we deny you access to your personal information, we will write to you to:\\r\\n\\x95\\t explain the reason your access request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do so\\r\\ngiven the grounds on which we have based our refusal; and\\r\\n\\x95\\t the avenues available to you to complain about our refusal.\\r\\nIf we refuse to give you access, if appropriate, we will attempt to find alternative means to enable you to access the\\r\\ninformation, for example, through a mutually agreed intermediary.\\r\\n7.2. Correction\\r\\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant and\\r\\nnot misleading. For instance, we may ask you to confirm some of your details when you deal with us via the Contact\\r\\nCentre. However, please contact us if you learn that any your personal information that we hold is incorrect, has\\r\\nchanged or requires updating.\\r\\nWe will respond to your correction request as soon as possible \\x96 or immediately, if you contact us by phone - and\\r\\ntell you how long it will take us to consider your correction request. This will usually be in less than 14 days, but\\r\\nmay be up to 28 days or more in unusual circumstances (e.g. where we are required to consult with other credit\\r\\nreporting bodies and/or credit providers in relation to the information).\\r\\nWe will promptly update your personal information if it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or\\r\\nmisleading having regard to the purpose for which it is held by us. If we correct the personal information the\\r\\nsubject of your correction request and we have previously disclosed that information to a third party, we will notify\\r\\nthat third party of the corrected information (if we\\x92re required to by law).\\r\\nIf we disagree with your request to correct your personal information we will write to you to:\\r\\n\\x95\\t explain the reason your correction request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do\\r\\nso; and\\r\\n\\x95\\t the avenues available to you to complain about our refusal.\\r\\nIf we disagree with your request to correct your personal information, you also have the right to ask us to attach a\\r\\nstatement that in your opinion the information inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. This\\r\\nright does not apply to our refusal to correct your credit information.\\r\\n8. Storage and protection of your personal information\\r\\n8.1. Storage and security\\r\\nWe store personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper based files and\\r\\nother records.\\r\\nWe are committed to protecting your personal information from misuse, loss and interference.

We de-identify or destroy your information when we no longer need it\\r\\nIf we no longer require your personal information for a purpose, for example, to manage your financial product or\\r\\nprovide you with a financial service, then we will take reasonable steps to securely destroy it or permanently remove\\r\\nall identifying features from that information. This obligation is subject to any legal requirements to keep personal\\r\\ninformation for a certain period of time \\x96 in most cases, personal information records are kept for a period of 7\\r\\nyears after their creation or 7 years after an account is closed.\\r\\n9.

This statement discloses the privacy practices for this website only, including an explanation of:\\r\\nthe categories of personally identifiable information about you that may be collected; how the information is used;\\r\\nhow we collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your use of the website;\\r\\nthe categories of persons or entities with whom the information may be shared;\\r\\nthe choices that are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information;\\r\\nhow you can opt in or out of Comcast promotional e-mail;\\r\\nthe kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information;\\r\\nhow you can review and request changes to the information;\\r\\nhow we notify visitors and users of this website of changes to this privacy statement; and\\r\\nthe privacy policies that apply to subscribers to each Comcast product and service.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions regarding this statement should be directed to Comcast through one of the Contact Us forms you will find on the website, or by mailing a notice to: Comcast Corporation One Comcast Center Philadelphia, PA 19103 Attention: Comcast.com Privacy Feedback\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation Collection and Use\\r\\nA special note about children: This website is not directed to children under the age of 13, and Comcast does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 on this website unless expressly specified on the appropriate pages of the website. However, some pages of the website may be of interest to children. On those pages, Comcast or its service providers may provide a special notice or other information describing any additional privacy protections that may apply. Children should always get permission from a parent or legal guardian before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat categories of personally identifiable information do we collect?\\r\\nThe information collected by Comcast falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to and users of the website and (2) tracking information recorded as visitors and users navigate through the website. Some of this information is personally identifiable information, but much of it is not. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make use of some features on our website visitors and users need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may ask, for example, for your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, and, if you wish to automate payments, financial account information. We might also request information about your residence, television, and computer, for example, in order to process your request for new service or make changes to existing service. In addition, we may ask you for information about your interests in television viewing, sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, complete the particular function of the website you are using, and tailor our website to your interests to make it more useful to you. Our systems will remember some of this information the next time you log in and use our website, but you can always review and change your information by following the instructions below under Changes to Information in this statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying this information is entirely voluntary. But if you choose not to supply the information, we may be unable to provide you with the products and services we make available to other users of and visitors to our website. And you will not be able to order selected products or services, or automate payments, over our website unless you provide certain personally identifiable information about yourself. When you submit any personally identifiable information over this website, Comcast (i) will use the information for the purposes described at the time you submit it (for example, your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address provided while ordering one of our products or services will be used in connection with the processing and fulfillment of your order) and (ii) may use the information to contact you to make you aware of other products and services of interest. Of course, if you want to remain completely anonymous, you\\'re still free to take advantage of the publicly available content on our website without registration.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat categories of persons or entities do we share personally identifiable information with?\\r\\nWe consider the personally identifiable information contained in our business records to be confidential. We may sometimes disclose personally identifiable information about you to our affiliates or to others who work for us. We may also disclose personally identifiable information about you to service providers and vendors, and to others who provide products and services to us. For example, when you use certain functions on this website you may notice that the website actually collecting or processing the information may be other than a Comcast website. We may be required by law or legal process to disclose certain personally identifiable information about you to lawyers and parties in connection with litigation and to law enforcement personnel. For example, we may be required by law to disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent and without notice in order to comply with a valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do we do to personalize your use of this website and the advertisements that may be presented to you on other websites?\\r\\nWe, or our advertising providers, may automatically deliver ads for third-party products as well as promotions and offers for our own products and services, to all users of this website, whether the users are registered or not, based on non-personal information including: (i) the IP address associated with your computer for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location; (ii) the type of web page that is being displayed, such as a page about Xfinity Internet; or (iii) the content on the page that is shown, such as an FAQ about programming your DVR. Because this activity automatically applies to all users and it is purely contextual, this type of content delivery cannot be customized or controlled by individual users.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help make our website more responsive to the needs of our users and visitors, we use a standard feature of browser software called a \"cookie.\" We use cookies to help us tailor our website to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service, and to remember certain choices you\\x92ve made so you don\\x92t have to re-enter them.\\r\\n\\r\\nComcast uses cookies, among other things, to remember your username and password, if you choose to store them, from the home page of the website at www.xfinity.com, as well as to remember some of your personalization preferences and website features. Comcast does not store your name or other personal information in cookies. You may read about enabling, disabling, and deleting cookies at www.xfinity.com at any time by searching for \\x93cookie\\x94 and clicking on the link for the topic you wish to read. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies or you delete them, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to and users of our website.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cookies we use don\\x92t directly identify visitors to or users of our website as particular persons. Rather, they contain information sufficient to simplify and improve a visitor\\x92s or user\\x92s experience on our website. For example, we may use session-based cookies to track the pages on our website visited by our users. We can build a better website if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Or, we may use persistent cookies to simplify access to a user\\x92s account information over our website, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn connection with the standard operation of Comcast\\x92s systems, certain non-personally identifiable information about visitors to this website is recorded. This information is used primarily to tailor and enhance visitors\\x92 experience using the website. We may use this information in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to, among other things, measure the use of our website and determine which products and services are the most popular with website visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may also use one or more advertising network providers and/or other audience segmenting technology providers to help present advertisements or other content on this website and other websites that display Comcast advertisements. These providers uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer or mobile or other device to serve you advertisements or content tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other websites you have visited. It also helps determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement or content before and in order to avoid sending you duplicates. In doing so, these providers collect non-personally identifiable information such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data. When you visit this website, these providers may use cookies or web beacons to note which product and service descriptions your browser visited. When you are presented with Comcast advertisements on other websites, we or these providers may use that information to select advertisements related to your interests. This is intended to provide you with an additional opportunity to look at Comcast offerings that may be of interest to you. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not Comcast\\x92s privacy policy for this website. If you do not want the benefits of the cookies used by these providers, you may opt-out of them by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp or by visiting their opt-out pages. The advertising network providers and/or audience segmenting technology providers that may collect information about your use of this website, and links to their opt-out pages, are available using the hyperlink below:\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising Networks and Other Technology Providers\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes Comcast offers different versions of and subscription plans for our products and services in different areas of the country. When you visit this website, we may use the internet protocol address associated with your computer to try to determine your general geographic area so that we can show you about the general offers for products and services that are available in your region. When you are interested in a specific product or service, we may also invite you to enter an address to determine exactly which offer, product or service is available to you. If you are already a Comcast customer and you log in to your account, we will use the address associated with your account to select available offers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere do we permit visitors and users to opt in or out of Comcast promotional e-mail or direct mail?\\r\\nYou may choose to receive, or not receive, promotional e-mails about Comcast\\x92s products and services by going to the Internet web page located at www.xfinity.com/preferences and following the instructions there. If you have otherwise provided your e-mail address to Comcast, or Comcast has already obtained it, then Comcast may have already contacted you about receiving promotional e-mails separately. You may contact Comcast at 1-800-COMCAST to ask us to put your name on our internal company \\x93do not mail\\x94 list so that you do not receive marketing or promotional postal mail from us or made at our request.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Websites\\r\\nTo make our website more valuable to our visitors, we may offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Our website may also include links to other websites whose privacy policies and practices we don\\'t control. Once you leave our website by linking to another one (you can tell where you are by checking the address - known as a URL - in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you\\'re visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can\\'t find the privacy policy of any of these websites via a link from the site\\'s homepage, you should contact the website directly for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity\\r\\nAll information gathered on our website is stored within a database accessible only to Comcast and its specifically authorized contractors and vendors. However, as effective as any security measure implemented by Comcast may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the complete security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won\\'t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. If you don\\'t want us to know any particular information about you, don\\'t include it in anything that you submit or post to this website or send to us in e-mail.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges to Information\\r\\nYou may review and change personally identifiable information that you provide to us through this website by returning to the pages where you entered it, and reviewing or changing the information directly. You may also request changes to some information, such as billing and account information if you are a Comcast customer, by calling Comcast at 1-800-COMCAST, if you are able to verify your identity using a Comcast account number, personal identification number or PIN, or another identifier requested by Comcast.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges to this Privacy Statement\\r\\nWe may change this privacy statement from time to time. If we change this privacy statement at some point in the future, we\\x92ll post the changes on our website and by continuing to use the website after we post any changes, you accept and agree to this privacy statement, as modified.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Policies for Comcast Products and Services\\r\\nThis privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for this website only. Comcast supplies a copy of the privacy notice that applies to our cable television, high-speed Internet, and phone products and services separately to our subscribers.  You may also view this privacy notice at www.xfinity.com at any time by searching for \\x93privacy policy\\x94 and clicking on the link for the privacy notice.', b'At Walmart, our customers are number one - always.

Information we receive from you includes information you share with us, such as when you create an account on one of our websites.  This also includes information you provide us through technology, such as through a cookie placed on your computer when you visit our websites.  We also receive information from other sources to help us supplement our records, improve the personalization of our service to you, and detect fraud.  Our goal is to limit the information we collect to the information needed to support our business.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect information to deliver the products and services you request and to help improve your shopping experience.

These choices are described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing Preferences\\r\\nWhen we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following standards:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use an opt-in standard for phone and text messages. We use an opt-in standard for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing, such as sending you promotions. Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent. \\r\\nWe use an opt-out standard for email or for other communications, such as postal mail. Opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below). \\r\\nPlease note that these standards may not apply to communications regarding our Health & Wellness operations, such as prescription reminders. For more information see the Health & Wellness Notice of Privacy Practices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, these standards may not apply to Walmart-branded credit card offerings because these are provided through associated financial institutions. However, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to www.optoutprescreen.com.  \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can provide us with your marketing preferences by visiting our Communication Preferences & Alerts page.

For instance, if you would like to opt-out of mail, include your mailing address. Please allow sufficient time for your marketing preferences to be processed. It may take up to ten days to process your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to telephone calls, text messages, and sharing information with your consent. Please note that postal mailings are often prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSince we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties, such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one of the mechanisms mentioned above.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes. Some examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, customer surveys, or recalls. We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order. \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest-Based Advertising Preferences \\r\\nWe personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.

These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event that we use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf, these companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel GIF or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.

If you choose to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests or surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level - note that you must be 18 or above to enter). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic, and to personalize our Site.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests.

You can send a photo or video Snap to friends, chronicle your day through My Story, touch base using Chat, immerse yourself in global events through Live, and enjoy handcrafted stories from the world\\xd5s top publishers on Discover.\\rWhen you use these services\\xd1and any others we roll out\\xd1you\\xd5ll inevitably share some information with us. We get that that can affect your privacy. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.\\rThat\\xd5s why we\\xd5ve written this privacy policy. And it\\xd5s why we\\xd5ve tried to write it in a way that\\xd5s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our privacy policy, just\\xcaping us.\\rInformation We Collect\\rThere are three basic ways we collect information:\\r* Information you choose to give us.\\r* Information we get automatically when you use our services.\\r* Information we get from third parties.\\rHere\\xd5s a little more detail on each of these categories.\\rInformation You Choose to Give Us\\rWhen you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you: a unique username you\\xd5d like to go by, a password, an email address, a phone number, and your date of birth. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information. And, of course, when you contact Snapchat Support or communicate with us in any other way, we\\xd5ll collect whatever information you volunteer.\\rInformation We Get Automatically When You Use Our Services\\rWhen you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you\\xd5ve used and how you\\xd5ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Live Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Snaps to friends. Here\\xd5s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:\\r* Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:\\ro how you interact with the services, such as which filters you apply to Snaps or which channels you watch on Discover.\\ro how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as the time, date, sender, recipient of a message, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).\\r* Content Information. We collect the content you provide and information about that content, such as if the recipient has viewed the content, replayed the content, and the metadata that is provided with the content.\\r* Device Information.\\ro We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).\\ro We also collect device information that will help us diagnose and troubleshoot problems in the (hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our services.\\r* Device Phonebook. Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we may\\xd1with your consent\\xd1collect information from your device\\xd5s phonebook.\\r* Camera and Photos. Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device\\xd5s camera and photos. We\\xd5ll never access the camera or photos unless you give us your consent to do so.\\r* Location Information. When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.\\r* Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique device identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how third parties use these technologies on our services, be sure to read the\\xcaAnalytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others\\xcasection of our privacy policy.\\r* Log Information. We collect log file information when you use our services. That information includes, among other things:\\ro details about how you\\xd5ve used our services\\ro device information, such as your web browser type and language\\ro access times\\ro pages viewed\\ro IP address\\ro pages you visited before navigating to our services\\ro cookies that may uniquely identify your device or browser\\rInformation We Collect from Third Parties\\rWe may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook\\xd1and you\\xd5re one of that user\\xd5s contacts\\xd1we may combine the information we collect from that user\\xd5s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other third-party sources and combine that with the information we collect through our services.\\rHow We Use Information\\rWhat do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:\\r* develop, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services\\r* communicate with you\\r* monitor and analyze trends and usage\\r* personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information or providing advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles, interests, or previous activities\\r* enhance the safety and security of our services\\r* verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity\\r* use information we\\xd5ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them\\rWe may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.\\rAlthough we welcome Snapchatters from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, you consent to us processing and transferring information in and to the United States and other countries whose data-protection and privacy laws may offer fewer protections than those in your home country.\\rHow We Share Information\\rWe may share information about you in the following ways:\\r* With other Snapchatters. We may share the following information about you with other Snapchatters:\\ro public information, such as your username, Snapcode, name, and profile pictures;\\ro information about how you have interacted with the services, such as your Snapchat \\xd2score,\\xd3 the names of Snapchatters you are friends with, and other information that will help Snapchatters understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Snapchat friends in common;\\ro any additional information you have consented to be shared. For example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook; and\\ro content you post or send will be shared with other Snapchatters and potentially the public at large; how widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a Snap may be sent to just a single friend you select, but a photo or video submitted to a Live Story may be seen by all Snapchatters and, if the Live Story is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, may be viewed by the public.\\r* With our affiliates. We may share information with entities within the Snapchat family of companies.\\r* With third parties. We may share your information with the following third parties:\\ro With service providers, sellers, and partners. We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.\\ro With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:\\r* comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;\\r* investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;\\r* protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or\\r* detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.\\ro With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Snapchat gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, or acquisition of some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.\\r* In the aggregate. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.\\rInformation You Choose to Share with Third Parties\\rThe services may also contain third-party links, include third-party integrations (like Pay to Replay), or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that\\xd5s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.\\rMessage Deletion and Retention\\rSnapchat captures what it\\xd5s like to live in the moment. So in many cases the messages sent through our services are automatically deleted from our servers once we detect that they have been viewed or have expired. And again in most cases, the services are programmed to delete a message from the recipient\\xd5s device once it\\xd5s been viewed or expired as well.\\rThere are some exceptions though to this rule. Some of our services, such as My Story, Replay, and Live, allow users to interact with the messages and content you provide through the services for a longer period of time. That means those messages and content may be available on our servers and a recipient\\xd5s device after they\\xd5ve been viewed or expired. For example, if you add a Snap to My Story, other users will be able to view it for roughly 24 hours. And because Snaps submitted to Live and other crowd-sourced Stories are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, we may save them indefinitely and allow them to be viewed again through any of our services or third-party sources.\\rBut\\xd1and this is important\\xd1you should understand that users who see your messages or any other content you provide can always save them, either by taking a screenshot or by using some other image-capture technology (whether that be software or even something as old-fashioned as a camera to take a photo of their device\\xd5s screen). If we\\xd5re able to detect that a recipient took a screenshot of a message you sent, we\\xd5ll try to notify you. But the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Don\\xd5t send messages that you wouldn\\xd5t want someone to save or share.\\rA few final words on deletion: We can\\xd5t guarantee that messages and corresponding metadata will be deleted within a specific timeframe. Keep in mind that we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law. This is true even after we\\xd5ve deleted messages and corresponding metadata from our servers. We also sometimes receive requests from law enforcement requiring us by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific information. Finally, of course, as with any digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients\\xd5 devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.\\rChoice and Control over Your Information\\rWe want you to be in control of your information, so we let you update or correct most of your basic Snapchat account information by editing your account settings within the app. Occasionally we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you update your information. And if you later change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality. And while we hope you\\xd5ll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go\\xcahere.\\rIt\\xd5s also important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with. That\\xd5s why we\\xd5ve built a number of tools in settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether you\\xd5d like to receive Snaps from just your friends or all Snapchatters, and whether you\\xd5d like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again.\\rAnalytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others\\rWe may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies on the services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.\\rAdditionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Snapchat does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral-advertising purposes, please visit\\xcawww.aboutads.info/choices.\\rChildren\\rWe don\\xd5t direct our Services to anyone under 13. And that\\xd5s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13.\\rRevisions to the Privacy Policy\\rWe may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, we\\xd5ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we\\xd5ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy that\\xd5s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites\\xd5 homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).\\r\\r', b'Privacy Policy\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and your privacy is important to us. We thank you for visiting this web site (the \"Web Site\") and reviewing our Privacy Policy. This notice describes our privacy policy.

The following privacy policies are tailored for the different ways your Personal Information is collected by different Oracle lines of business and offerings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle Corporation and our subsidiaries and affiliates (\"Oracle\" or \"we\") respect your preferences concerning the treatment of Personal Information that we may collect. This policy lets you know how we collect and use your Personal Information, how you can control its use, and describes our practices regarding information collected from the different Oracle sites that link or refer to this policy (such as our websites, computer or mobile software applications, social media pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages), as well as through offline sales and marketing activities (collectively, the \"Channels\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Channels may provide links to or the ability to connect with non-Oracle websites, services, social networks or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share information about you. Those third-party websites or services are beyond our control. We encourage you to check the privacy policies and terms of use of any non-Oracle websites or services before providing your Personal Information to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal and Other Information We Collect\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough your interaction with and use of the Channels, Oracle may collect Personal Information, which is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, company affiliation and associated interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle may also collect Other Information through your interaction with and use of the Channels and non-Oracle websites, which does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual. Other Information may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, statistical and aggregated information.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but it may be derived from Personal Information. For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of users in a particular zip code.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information, such as combining a precise geographical location with your name. If we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow We Use and Share Information\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal Information\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle uses and shares the Personal Information it collects (unless otherwise restricted by applicable law), to:\\r\\n\\r\\nEngage in Transactions.

Oracle may use your Personal Information to notify you about new product releases and service developments, and to advertise Oracle\\'s products and services in accordance with this Policy.

Oracle may also use Personal Information in order to respond directly to your information requests (including newsletter registrations or other specific requests), or pass your contact information to the appropriate Oracle distributor or reseller for further follow-up related to your interests. In addition, if you consent, Oracle may share your Personal Information with other selected partners that offer complementary products or services. Please review the specific partner\\'s privacy policy regarding any further interactions with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvide Oracle Online Communities. Some Channels permit you to: participate in interactive discussions; create a profile; post comments, opportunities or other content; communicate directly with another user; or otherwise engage in networking activities. Some of these services are moderated and all may be accessed for technical reasons. Oracle does not control the content that users post to these forums or social networks. You should carefully consider whether you wish to submit Personal Information to these forums or social networks and whether you wish to make your profile available to other users, and you should tailor any content you submit appropriately. You should also review any additional terms and conditions that may govern your use of these Channels.

This may include information about the event\\'s content, logistics, payment, updates, and any additional meetings, special demonstrations or other customer facilitation that we may provide related to your event registration. After the event, Oracle may contact you about the event and related products and services, and may share information about your attendance with your company. Where legally permitted, Oracle will also allow designated partners or conference sponsors to send you up to two communications related to your event attendance. Please note that our partners or conference sponsors may directly request your Personal Information at their conference booths or presentations. You should review their privacy policies to learn how they use Personal Information.\\r\\n\\r\\nObtain Third Party Services.

If you visit our offices, you may be photographed or videotaped as part of maintaining the security of our facilities. Facility security photography will be treated as sensitive information and will only be used for security and investigation purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nComply with Legal Requirements and Corporate Transactions.

Please refer to the \"Registration, Preferences and Opt Out\" section below for information on available use preferences or opt-out options, or view the summary of your Privacy Choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may use, transfer, and disclose Other Information we collect for any purpose, except where applicable law requires otherwise. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we will only use it in the same way that we are permitted to use and disclose Personal Information.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow We Collect Information\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle and our third party service providers may collect both Personal Information and Other Information from a variety of sources that generally fall into three categories:\\r\\n\\r\\nDirect Interactions: From your use of and interaction with us through the Channels and other activities such as account creation, submission of registrations and forms, or sales inquiries and transactions.\\r\\nPublicly Available Data / Data from Third Parties: Data from Automated Interactions on non-Oracle websites, or other data you may have made publicly available, such as social media posts, or data provided by third party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists, or data aggregators.\\r\\nAutomated Interactions: From the use of technologies such as electronic communication protocols, cookies, embedded URLs or pixels, or widgets, buttons and tools.\\r\\nAlthough Oracle\\'s use of Automated Interactions may change over time as technology evolves, the following descriptions are designed to provide you with additional detail about Oracle\\'s current approach to information collected from Automated Interactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectronic Communications Protocols: As is true when you visit most websites and apps, Oracle may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection itself, which often consists of network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), your IP address (which may identify your general geographic location or company), and date and time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle may also automatically receive and record information about your interaction with the Channels, such as clickstream information (when each Oracle webpage was visited and how much time was spent on the page), or general geo-location data.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies: Oracle\\'s server will query your browser to see if there are \"cookies\" previously set by our electronic Channels. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store on a Web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. Cookies may collect information, including a unique identifier, user preferences, profile information, membership information, and general usage and volume statistical information. Cookies may also be used to collect individualized web site use data, provide electronic Channel personalization, or conduct and measure the effectiveness of advertising in accordance with this Policy. Some cookies may remain on users\\' computers after they leave the Website. While the majority are set to expire within 1-24 months of your last visit to the website that set the cookie, others may not expire because of their nature, like cookies that remember opt-out preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour browser may provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and accept or reject the cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion. Cookies, however, are important to the proper functioning of a site, and disabling them may degrade your experience and interfere with Web site features and customizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle has engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with electronic Channels. The service provider(s) set cookies on behalf of Oracle. Oracle also uses other third party cookies to provide advertising and personalization services in accordance with this Policy, and to track the performance of Oracle advertisements on their websites and Oracle e-mails.\\r\\n\\r\\nManaging Cookie Preferences: You may access or change your cookie preferences at any time. If you have any problems using this cookie preference mechanism, please fill out an inquiry form.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlash Cookies: We may use Flash cookies, also known as \"local shared objects,\" on our electronic Channels that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are used to remember the site\\'s settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at macromedia.com.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmbedded URLs: Oracle may use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the electronic Channels without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the electronic Channels, but are not associated with Personal Information and are not used beyond the session.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmbedded Pixels and Similar Technologies: On the electronic Channels, Oracle and its service providers may use embedded pixel technologies for the purposes of identifying unique user visits (as opposed to aggregate hits), and for advertising purposes. In addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in e-mails and our online display advertising to provide information on when the e-mail or ad was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient\\'s e-mail address.\\r\\n\\r\\nWidgets, Buttons, and Tools: Our electronic Channels may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies\\' services (e.g., a \"Like\" button or third party map). The widget, button or tool may collect and automatically send Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, or Other Information (such as your browser information, or IP address), to a third party. Cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. Information collected or used by a widget, button or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysical Location: We may collect the physical location of your device and use it to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device\\'s location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegistration, Preferences, and Opt-Out\\r\\n\\r\\nA list of your current Privacy Choices is listed on the following tab.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegistration\\r\\nOracle allows you to establish an online registration profile for marketing communications at Oracle.com. You may use the profile to customize and control your preferences for receiving electronic information, including opting into (or out of) communities, newsletters and general interest areas. You can return to the registration profile at any time to change your elections or modify your profile at https://profile.oracle.com/. Please login as usual and follow the prompts to \"update my profile.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPreferences and Opt-Out.\\r\\nE-mail Marketing. Oracle enables you to opt out of marketing communications. You may opt out of e-mail marketing by modifying your online profile as described above or by using our general unsubscribe automated link that is included in Oracle marketing e-mails. You can find details on how to automatically unsubscribe from e-mail communications, as well as how to submit requests to opt-out from phone and postal marketing, on our Oracle.com Account Help page. If you have any problems using any of these opt-out mechanisms, please fill out an inquiry form.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome non-marketing communications are not subject to general opt-out, such as communications related to product download, sales transactions, software updates and other support related information, patches and fixes, conferences or events for which you have registered, disclosures to comply with legal requirements, and (where permitted by law) quality assurance surveys. Some additional communications with partners are also not subject to general-opt out, including product alerts, updates, contractual marketing and sales materials, and other notices related to partner status.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies and Do Not Track Preferences. Oracle enables you to opt out of cookies that are not required to enable core site functionality. Oracle uses its cookies preferences tool to processes Internet advertising and tracking preferences, but does not process any other Do Not Track signals. Once you have set your cookie preferences, Oracle will follow the specific choices you made there. Please remember that if you delete your cookies, or use a different browser or computer, you will need to set your cookies preferences again. You may access or change your cookie preferences at any time. If you have any problems using this cookie preference mechanism, please fill out an inquiry form.\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle enables you to opt out of personalized (non-anonymized) website analytics. You may access or change your website analytics preferences at any time. If you have any problems using this website analytics preference mechanism, please fill out an inquiry form.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation-Sharing Choices. Oracle only shares Personal Information with selected companies after providing users the ability to make choices about the sharing, or as otherwise described in this Policy. There are limitations to opting out of such sharing in the case of: (1) joint sales or joint events; (2) where the customer has requested follow-up which involves Oracle partners; (3) where third parties are required to accomplish the transaction or perform the service; and (4) where required by law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird Party Permission-Based Lists. On occasion, Oracle may use third-party lists to send communications about Oracle products and services. These lists, which are maintained by third parties, include users eligible under applicable law to receive e-mails from other companies such as Oracle. When we use such lists, the communications will include mechanisms to opt out of receiving Oracle marketing communications. If you have trouble opting out, or if you wish to make us aware of any issues related to a third-party mailing, you may contact us directly through our inquiry form.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor California Residents. Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as S.B. 27), if you are a California resident and your business relationship with Oracle is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may request certain data regarding Oracle\\'s disclosure, if any, of Personal Information to third parties for the third-parties\\' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please fill out an inquiry form; you may make such a request up to once per calendar year. If applicable, we will provide you, by e-mail, a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the third parties\\' names and addresses. Please note that not all Personal Information sharing is covered by S.B. 27\\'s requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess, Correction, and Profile Updates\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may request to review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise modify any of your Personal Information that you have previously provided to us through the Channels, or object to the use or processing of such Personal Information by us. You have the ability to update your Oracle profile and related Personal Information at any time. To change this information, please login at https://profile.oracle.com/ and follow the prompts to \"update my profile.\" If you have questions about your account or are having trouble accessing your account, you can get answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and request help with your account. If you have privacy concerns regarding access to or the correction of your Personal Information, please contact us through our inquiry form, or write to us at the following address:\\r\\n\\r\\n7700 Technology Way\\r\\nDenver, CO 80237\\r\\nAttn: Chief Privacy Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your request, please make clear what Personal Information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information that you have provided to us suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information that you have provided to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the majority of questions and issues related to access can be handled quickly, complex requests may take more research and time. In such cases, issues will be addressed, or you will be contacted regarding the nature of the problem and appropriate next steps, within thirty days.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetention and Deletion\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active; as needed to provide you products or services; as needed for the purposes outlined in this policy or at the time of collection; as necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to honor opt-outs), resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; or to the extent permitted by law.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the retention period, Oracle will delete your Personal Information in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle uses some third parties to administer a limited set of Oracle advertisements on third party electronic channels. No Personal Information is provided to the advertisers as part of this process, but aggregate profile information or Other Information, such as user community or implied or inferred interests, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user. Some banner ads may contain embedded pixels that may write and read cookies or return session connection information that allows advertisers to better determine how many individual users have clicked on the ad banner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle may also use advertising technologies and participate in advertising technology networks that collect Other Information from Oracle and non-Oracle websites, as well as from other sources, to show you Oracle-related advertisements on Oracle\\x92s own and third-party websites. These advertisements may be tailored to your perceived interests using retargeting and behavioral advertising technologies, a set of practices collectively referred to as \\x93Interest Based Advertising\\x94 in this policy. Any retargeted or behavioral advertisements served to your browser will contain information on or near it that informs you about the advertising technology partner and how to opt-out of viewing such advertisements. You also may opt out by visiting the Interest Based Advertising portion of the Privacy Choices tab of this policy. Opting-out does not mean that you will stop receiving ads from Oracle.

These cookie-based opt-out tools may not be as reliable where (e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems) cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed.

Instructions on uninstalling our toolbar and our coupon printer software are available here.\\r\\n\\r\\nA device identifier stays on your computer even after uninstalling the coupon printer software. This identifier is used solely to prevent coupon fraud and does not collect personally identifiable information.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookie & Web Beacon Information: When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to your computer. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. These persistent cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different. Please review your browser\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Help menu to learn how to modify your cookies setup. Our Sites also use web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are placed in the code of a webpage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAffiliate Cookies: Cookies sent to your computer by us, or our Affiliates on our behalf, are governed by this Privacy Policy. The independent use of cookies by our Affiliates is not covered by this privacy policy, as we do not have access or control over such cookies.  Generally speaking, such cookies are used by Affiliates to provide you with customized advertising. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, please consult your browser\\'s help menu.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutomatically Collected Information: When you use the Sites or open one of our emails, we use technology (including web beacons and cookies, IP addresses, unique device IDs, user IDs, and log files) to automatically collect non-personally identifiable information including:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Coupon activity (including requesting, printing, and saving to a loyalty account).\\r\\n    Application activity (such as searches performed and features accessed).\\r\\n    Web browser type.\\r\\n    The website that referred you to us.\\r\\n    The web pages you viewed on the Sites.\\r\\n    The advertisements you viewed and clicked on the Sites.\\r\\n    The dates and times that you visited the Sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may link automatically collected information to personally identifiable information you submit while on the Sites when you are logged in or in connection with a service you have requested. For example, if you sign up for our Grocery iQ application, we will store your user ID together with your email address so that you can manage and (if you chose to) share your shopping list.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell-A-Friend: If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our coupons, we will ask you for your friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name and email address. We will use the information you provide to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to view the coupon you recommended. We delete the email address shortly after fulfilling your request and do not share it with any third party.\\r\\n\\r\\nLists & List Sharing: If you use our Grocery iQ mobile application, or our Grocery iQ website, we will collect and store for you the items you put on your list. We also may use that information to serve you tailored advertising, coupons or other content. For instance, if your list includes baby food, we may present you with a coupon or advertisement from us or an Affiliate for baby food or related items, such as diapers. If you choose to invite someone to share your shopping list, we will ask you to provide us with that person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s email address in order to send them your invitation. We store this information in order to administer the list sharing feature, but we do not share it with any third party. \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation Information: Use of the Sites, including our mobile applications, may include location-based services. If you use those services, we may receive information about your location which we may use to send you geographically relevant promotions or advertisements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalytic Tools: We may use tools such as Google Analytics to better understand who is using our Sites and how they are using them. These tools use cookies to collect information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used. We use this information to manage and improve our Sites. You can learn how to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking software here.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromotions, Sweepstakes, & Contests: From time to time, we may sponsor sweepstakes, contests, other promotions or surveys. Personal information may be required as a condition of participation for purposes of verifying entrants\\' identities, notifying winners and fulfilling prizes. We will not use or disclose any such information unless we receive your consent to do so. If we engage a third party to assist us in administering a promotion or fulfilling prizes, this information will be disclosed to that third party.\\r\\n\\r\\nData Retention: We retain all information we collect about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. \\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n2. How We Use Your Information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use all of the information that we collect from your use of the Sites, any information you provide when you register with us, and information provided to us by third parties as described below.  The following are the ways we use information we collect:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Operate, maintain, deliver, and communicate with you about the coupons, advertisements, content, and promotional offerings found on the Sites.\\r\\n    Process and record coupon requesting and redemption activity.\\r\\n    Manage and store shopping lists.\\r\\n    Monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\\r\\n    Aggregate usage metrics (such as total number of visitors to the Sites and pages viewed, application usage and downloads, and interaction with advertisements).\\r\\n    Understand usage trends and preferences.\\r\\n    Improve the way the Sites work and look.\\r\\n    Improve our marketing and promotional efforts.\\r\\n    Provide you with a personalized experience on the Sites (such as recognizing your system so that you will not have to re-enter information during your current or future visit to the Sites).\\r\\n    Provide you with custom, personalized coupon promotions and advertisements on and off our Sites.\\r\\n    Create new features and functionality.\\r\\n    For other non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as customer service purposes).\\r\\n    We also may use the device information to provide targeted ads to you based on your printing and redemption activity. \\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n3. When We Share Information\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonally Identifiable Information: We do not share personally identifiable information with our Affiliates or other third-parties for their marketing or promotional uses except as part of a specific program or feature that you have chosen to participate in. For example, we offer coupons on our Sites that require you to fill out an advertiser survey in order to receive the coupon. If you choose to participate in the survey, then we will share the information you provide with the advertiser who provided the survey. You may be given the option to register with the website of one of our Affiliates, or sign up for an Affiliate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newsletter. If we manage the website for the Affiliate and you choose to register or sign up with that Affiliate, then we will share the information you provide with that Affiliate. In addition, we may use your personally identifiable information for the purpose of obtaining associated non-personally identifiable information from third parties, but we do not permit those third parties to use your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with associated non-personally identifiable information.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-Personally Identifiable Information: We aggregate non-personally identifiable information (such as age, gender, household income, interests, zip code, state, coupon print and redemption data, and other automatically collected information that does not personally identify you) and share such aggregated information with our Affiliates in order to help them improve the marketing of their products and services. We may also share such non-personally identifiable information with our Affiliates when you interact with our promotional content on their websites. An Affiliate may match the non-personally identifiable information we provide with personally identifiable information you have previously provided to that Affiliate. For instance, if you have signed up for a loyalty account from one of our Affiliates, such as a grocery retailer, and request that our coupon be saved to that loyalty account, we will provide the Affiliate with the coupon and other information necessary to fulfill your request. The Affiliate will then match the information with your loyalty account which may contain your personally identifiable information. We also may share such non-personally identifiable information with third-party ad servers, ad networks, and data exchanges (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAd Partners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) so that they can tailor their advertisements to your apparent interests and deliver those advertisements to you while you are either on our Sites or on third-party websites. For example, if you print pet food coupons, then an Ad Server may conclude that you have a pet and display a pet care supply advertisement instead of a random advertisement. In addition, Ad Partners themselves use technologies (such as cookies, pixels, and beacons) to collect information about your browsing behavior on our Sites which they may match with information they have previously collected (including personally identifiable information you have provided to them). However, we do not share personally identifiable information with Ad Partners, and we do not permit Ad Partners to collect personally identifiable information about you on our Sites. For information about how to opt out of receiving behavioral advertisements from advertising partners click here.\\r\\n\\r\\nExceptions: We may share information about you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with local, state, or federal laws or to respond to a court order, judicial or other governmental subpoena or warrant, or in the event of bankruptcy proceedings. We also reserve the right to share information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability, protect us or our Affiliates from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, assist government enforcement agencies, protect the security or integrity of the Sites, and to protect our rights, property, or safety and those of our Affiliates and others. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n4. Your Choices\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are registered with us, you may modify, correct, or delete your personally identifiable information and preferences at any time by going to the Member Center on our website or by contacting us. We will respond to you within 30 days from the date you contact us.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo protect your privacy and security, we require you to enter your email address and password before allowing access to your account on the Member Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you no longer wish to receive weekly coupon email alerts and other special offers from us you can opt-out by either following the instructions included in each email, changing your preferences in the Member Center on our website, or by contacting us.

Facebook Connect\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be given the opportunity to register with us via Facebook Connect. We will collect and store the information you provide us through Facebook Connect (including personally identifiable information) with any other registration information you provide us. Disabling your Facebook Connect may not terminate your account with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n6. Community Forum\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may ourselves manage and operate a discussion board or other forum (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommunity Forum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) within the Sites, or use a third party hosted and managed site, for general matters of interest regarding our coupons and Sites or special programs we offer. The use of any Community Forum feature on our Sites is subject to the forum rules posted on the Community Forum site, and the use of a Community Forum on a third party site will be subject to that third-party site\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forum rules. Please take special note that if you post any personally identifiable information to a Community Forum, then that information can be read, collected, and used by other users of the Community Forums. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the personally identifiable information you post to a Community Forum, and we are not responsible for any use of information you post to a Community Forum, whether hosted by us or a third party.    \\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n7. Our Commitment to Data Security\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sites incorporate physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Additional security measures, such as Secure Sockets Layer (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSSL\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) or other technology, will be used if you engage in financial transactions on our Sites. However, as no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n8. Our Commitment To Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Privacy\\r\\n\\r\\nProtecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Sites is structured to attract anyone under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Sites at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Sites without verified parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n \\r\\n9.

Scan results and log files include the following information: account verification information; identification of the operating system; and information about threats discovered that are cured, quarantined, or continue to infect your computer.\\r\\n\\r\\n    StopSign and eAcceleration products prompt before installing, so even if you have opted to \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways trust content from eAcceleration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you will be prompted before products are installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonalization:\\r\\n\\r\\n    We do not obtain personally identifiable information from you, unless you expressly give that information to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Free Trial users are not required to provide any private information to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n    We use a unique machine identification number associated with your computer, called a GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier), along with an account email, to activate your account, keep your StopSign account status current, and help diagnose any problems with our server.

If during your visit you personalize the Site, complete an order form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may provide us with Personal Information. We may collect and use that Personal Information to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, to tell you about ExxonMobil products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a visitor of our Site, you may be asked that we read the geolocation of your computer or mobile device; this geolocation information will be used to provide the services you request such as showing the location of nearby service stations, and the route to service stations; we may also use this geolocation information to tell you about ExxonMobil products and services, for instance in combination with weather information about the geolocation of your computer or mobile device. If you do not wish us to use the geolocation information for such purposes, you can decline our request to read the geolocation; in that case, some of the services of our Site may not be delivered. We may provide the geolocation information to third parties who assist us in the provision of the services and communications to you through the Site. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs explained below in the section on Dissemination of Information to Third Parties, we do not distribute or sell Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services to you; moreover, as explained in the Opt Out/Modify Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your Personal Information from our database in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us, if that is your wish. If you notify us that Personal Information previously submitted to our site is no longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections.

Any information you enter into our website will be treated as personal information. Personal information may include your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address as well as information about your investments, your investment goals and your tolerance for risk.

We may obtain this information by tracking when you use our Website, which pages you view at which times and similar data through our Web server software and \"cookies, web beacons and clear GIFs or tracking pixels\".\\r\\n\\r\\ntop\\r\\n\\r\\nOur use of cookies, web beacons, clear GIF, tracking pixels and similar mechanisms\\r\\nA cookie is a small data file that a websites can send to the browser on your computer when you link to that websites. It is not a computer program. A cookie does not extract personal information about you, such as your name and address, from your computer. It does not read data on your hard drive or instruct your computer to perform any function. A cookie sent to your browser from our websites can be used by our websites to recognize your computer whenever you subsequently log onto our websites. We also use cookies to track your usage patterns of our websites, such as how frequently you log in, which pages you use, when and for how long. Tracking information we may obtain by using a cookie may also be associated with personal information we may have collected about you.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be able to use your browser to give you the option of accepting or rejecting a cookie whenever visit a websites. You may also be able to use your browser or other software to clear cookies from your hard drive any time you wish. However, deleting a website\\'s cookie may mean that our websites will not recognize you as a repeat user. As a result you may have to re-enter information and reject a new websites cookie every time you attempt to access the website. Besides cookies we may use web beacons clear GIFs, tracking pixels or similar tracking mechanisms to also track your usage patterns of our websites. Like cookies, these small files also do not store, record or share any personal information about you. We utilize third party Internet services vendors to collect site traffic data through the use of these web beacons and clear GIFs or traffic pixels that can be embedded in our websites. These vendors can then provide us with completely anonymous usage data to allow us to improve our websites. This usage data cannot in any way be associated with any personal information we have about you.\\r\\n\\r\\ntop\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity of information transmissions\\r\\nInformation you provide to us when filling out forms or requests for information on our websites, as well as information we supply when you are visiting those areas, is protected while passing through the Internet using encryption technology called Secure Sockets Layer or SSL. Your browser will indicate when you are within a secure area of our websites by displaying a symbol, such as a locked padlock or an unbroken key. Encryption technology scrambles transmissions so it is incomprehensible to third parties. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Internet transmissions cannot be made absolutely secure. We will not be liable for the unintended disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of or breaches of security by third parties.

Third party sites may have privacy policies controlling the collection and use of personal information about you that are different from our privacy policy.

We may have access to this information to permit us to identify other websites that you have visited that are also associated with that third party. In doing so, however, these third parties do not collect personal information (unless you explicitly provide it to them), and we do not give any personally identifiable information to them. These third parties may collect certain non-personally identifiable information such as what web site a visitor came from, your IP address, and what type of browser you are using. We do not control the dissemination of these third party cookies, web beacons and similar mechanisms, and you should check the relevant third party websites for more information and whether and how you may opt out of receiving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges to our Privacy Policy\\r\\nWe may make changes to our Privacy Policy in the future. If you are a client, we will not make any change affecting you without first sending you a revised Privacy Policy describing the change. Similar changes will also be described on our websites.\\r\\n\\r\\nContacting us\\r\\nIf you have any questions about this privacy policy, please call us at 1-877-806-4573 and ask for our Privacy Information Center.', b'\\r\\nAbout this website privacy policy\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a model website privacy policy, referred to now by the UK Information Commissioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cICO\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) as a privacy notice. It is written in plain language that is visitor friendly. We have provided a large menu of paragraphs so that you can easily tailor the notice to suit the exact structure of your business and website.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough this document cannot magically absolve you from risk of data mismanagement, it is a giant first step. Informing your visitors and customers (and other parties) about the data you collect about them is a legal requirement. A privacy notice is a simple way to comply, but a good privacy notice goes further. It is prime evidence to everyone you deal with and to the ICO, that you take confidentiality seriously. That can help increase the trust that visitors and customers have in your business and boost confidence in using your services or buying from you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the privacy notice, we have included a copy of the ICO guidelines in Word format.\\r\\nThe law in this privacy notice\\r\\n\\r\\nA combination of telephone hacking, other privacy scandals and the publication of an amendment to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations has completely changed the scenery in the area of privacy law and the expectations of those with whom we deal. There are new rules for websites that use cookies and similar technologies and for companies that send marketing or advertising material electronically. In essence, the vast majority of businesses will need to update their privacy policies to comply with the new rules. Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to \\xc2\\xa3500,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ICO has provided a guide to what you should and should not be saying in your privacy notice. However, the law is new, and has been handed to the UK from Europe. It is clear that the ICO does not know how its requirements will unfold. We find the ICO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guidance at times is unspecific and muddled. So as to provide our customers with the greatest possible level of compliance, the Net Lawman website privacy policy follows the guidance as closely as possible, expanding with greater detail in areas that are less clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Net Lawman website privacy policy complies with UK law, including the Data Protection Act. (Note that having a privacy notice is just part of the requirements for compliance with the DPA).\\r\\nWhen to use this website privacy policy\\r\\n\\r\\nWebsite owners have until May 2012 before the ICO will enforce the new rules strictly. However, because the law is in force now, and because there are benefits to having a good privacy policy, we recommend that you update your notice as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a website, regardless of whether you are trading from it, it is highly likely that you will be collecting information about your customers in some way, even if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the information. A common example of information collection that is covered by the law is anonymous visitor tracking. If you use Google Analytics, weblogs or any similar software, your privacy policy will need to disclose this.\\r\\nPrivacy notice features and contents\\r\\n\\r\\nYour privacy notice should reflect the way your organisation collects and uses data. This will change between organisations enough to make each privacy policy unique, but with common elements that can be covered with standardised statements. In short, you will need to edit your privacy policy to reflect how your website and organisation operates, but we have done much of the legwork for you to make it an easy process.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 29 paragraphs in this document. In places we have provided a number of possibilities, where you choose the most appropriate from the menu and delete the others. In other places, we have provided ideas and the most common scenarios, but the notice may require a little customisation to reflect fully your business.\\r\\nThe notice is drawn around:\\r\\n\\r\\n    reminding you how to avoid contravening the UK Data Protection Act and the new EU regulations;\\r\\n    providing re-assurance to your customers or clients;\\r\\n    maintaining a professional but friendly image.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of the document include:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Categorisation of different types of information and how you use them\\r\\n    How you collect, use and store financial information\\r\\n    Information security and data retention\\r\\n    Fraud prevention\\r\\n    Cookies\\r\\n    Collection of information by other means (such as telephone calls and e-mails)\\r\\n    Complaints\\r\\n    Compliance with the law and disclosure to government\\r\\n    Processing data outside the UK\\r\\n    Data review, removal and update\\r\\n    Third party advertising\\r\\n    Use of site by children\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the privacy notice, we have included a copy of the ICO guidelines in Word format.\\r\\nDraftsman\\r\\n\\r\\nThis document is drawn by Net Lawman lawyers to comply with current English law.', b\"Daimler appreciates your interest in its products and your visit to this website.

This will include information you provide when you apply to us, and any additional information provided by you or others in various ways, including:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) in applications, emails and letters, during telephone calls and conversations in branch, when registering for services, in customer surveys, when you participate in competitions and promotions, through Lloyds Banking Group company websites, and during financial reviews and interviews.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) from analysis (for example, the amount frequency, location, origin, and recipient) of your payments and other transactions, and your use of services involving other Lloyds Banking Group companies and what they know from operating your account (including the creation of profiles used to uniquely identify you when you use our online, mobile and telephony services) which are used to help us combat fraud and other illegal activity ;and\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) information Lloyds Banking Group companies receive from each other, from or through other organisations (for example card associations, credit reference agencies, insurance companies, retailers, comparison websites, social networks, and fraud prevention agencies) whether in the course of providing products and services to you or otherwise, and from information we gather from your use of and interaction with our internet and mobile banking services and the devices you use to access them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for the maintenance of your account, or for legal or regulatory requirements.\\r\\nHow we share your information\\r\\nWe may share the personal information we hold about you across the Lloyds Banking Group for the following administrative activities:\\r\\n(a) providing you with products and services and notifying you about either important changes or developments to the features and operation of those products and services;\\r\\n(b) responding to your enquiries and complaints;\\r\\n(c) administering offers, competitions, and promotions;\\r\\n(d) undertaking financial reviews;\\r\\n(e)facilitating the secure access to online platforms\\r\\n\\r\\nand also for the following data sharing activities:\\r\\n(f)updating, consolidating, and improving the accuracy of our records\\r\\n(g) undertaking transactional analysis;\\r\\n(h) arrears and debt recovery activities;\\r\\n(i) testing new systems and checking upgrades to existing systems;\\r\\n(j) crime detection, prevention, and prosecution;\\r\\n(k) evaluating the effectiveness of marketing, and for market research and training;\\r\\n(l) customer modelling, statistical and trend analysis, with the aim of developing and improving products and services;\\r\\n(m) assessing lending and insurance risks across the Lloyds Banking Group;\\r\\n(n) managing your relationship with the Lloyds Banking Group companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy sharing this information it enables us, and other companies in the Lloyds Banking Group, to better understand your needs and run your accounts in the efficient way that you expect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYour data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission, or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.\\r\\nWhen we may share your information\\r\\nWe will treat your personal information as private and confidential, but may share it with each other and disclose it outside the Lloyds Banking Group if:\\r\\n(a) allowed by this agreement;\\r\\n(b) you consent;\\r\\n(c) needed by our agents, advisers or others involved in running accounts and services for you or collecting what you owe Group companies;\\r\\n(d) needed by subcontractors to help us manage your records;\\r\\n(e) HM Revenue & Customs or other authorities require it;\\r\\n(f) the law, regulatory bodies, or the public interest permits or requires it;\\r\\n(g) required by us or others to investigate or prevent crime;\\r\\n(h) needed by market research companies to assist us in providing better products and services for you; or\\r\\n(i) to any other parties connected with your account (including guarantors).\\r\\n(j) required as part of our duty to protect your accounts, for example we are required to disclose your information to the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will always ensure your information remains safe and secure.\\r\\nUsing your information to help prevent terrorism\\r\\nThe Government also requires us to screen applications that are made to us to ensure we are complying with the international fight against terrorism and other criminal activities. As a result of this we may need to disclose information to government bodies.\\r\\nSharing your information to assist with asset buying or selling\\r\\nLloyds Banking Group companies may in the future wish to sell, transfer or merge part or all of their business or assets, or any associated rights or interests, or to acquire a business or enter into a merger with it. If so, they may disclose your personal information to a potential buyer, transferee, or merger partner or seller and their advisers so long as they agree to keep it confidential and to use it only to consider the possible transaction. If the transaction goes ahead, the buyers, transferee or merger partner may use or disclose your personal information in the same way as set out in this notice.\\r\\nSharing your personal information with credit card providers\\r\\nIf you hold a credit or debit card with us, we will share transaction details with our scheme providers (e.g. Visa or Mastercard).\\r\\nSearching insurance records\\r\\nIf you apply to us for insurance, we will pass your details to the insurer. If you make a claim, any information you give to us, or to the insurer, may be put onto a register of claims and shared with other insurers to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of the participants is available from the insurer. We may also disclose your information within our group of companies, to our agents and other insurers to investigate or prevent fraud.\\r\\nSharing your personal information between 1st and 2nd charge lenders\\r\\nIf you have a secured loan or mortgage with us, we may need to share information with other lenders who also hold a charge on your property.\\r\\nJoint applicants\\r\\nIf you give personal information about someone else (such as a joint applicant) then you should not do so without their permission. Where information is provided by you about someone else, or someone discloses information about you, it may be added to any personal information that is already held by us and it will be used in the ways described in this privacy notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, when you open a joint account or product, this may mean that your personal data will be shared with the other applicant. For example, transactions made by you will be seen by your joint account holder and vice versa.\\r\\nHow we manage sensitive personal information\\r\\nThe Data Protection Act defines certain information as \\x91sensitive\\x92 (racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual life, criminal proceedings and offences). If you apply to us for insurance, a pension, health insurance or life assurance, we may ask you for some \\x91sensitive\\x92 details. We will only use this information to provide the service you require and we will ask for your explicit consent. As a customer, there may be times when you give us sensitive information. We may share it with other parts of the group and our subcontractors to keep your records up to date.\\r\\nHow we manage information collected on credit card statements\\r\\nSome transactions that you or additional card holders make on a card account may cause sensitive or confidential details to appear on your statement.  By using your card to make such transactions you give us your explicit consent to process this information.\\r\\nUsing companies to process your information outside the EAA\\r\\nAll countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the UK, have similar standards of legal protection for your personal information. We may run your accounts and provide other services from centres outside the EEA (such as the USA and India) that do not have a similar standard of data protection laws to the UK. If so, we will require your personal information to be protected to at least UK standards.  We may process payments through other financial institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the SWIFT organisation if, for example, you make a CHAPS payment or a foreign payment. Those external organisations may process and store your personal information abroad and may have to disclose it to foreign authorities to help them in their fight against crime and terrorism. If these are based outside the EEA, your personal information may not be protected to standards similar to those in the UK.\\r\\nUsing credit scoring\\r\\nWhen you apply for credit, an automated system known as credit scoring may be used when considering whether to agree the borrowing. It is a method of assessing your likely conduct of an account based on a range of data, including the conduct of previous similar accounts. It is a system widely used by credit providers to help make fair and informed decisions on lending.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit scoring takes account of information from three sources - the information you provide on your application, information provided by credit reference agencies and information that may already be held about you by companies in the Lloyds Banking Group. A credit scoring system will consider information from these sources, to make an overall assessment of your application.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe credit scoring methods used are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased.  Using a credit scoring system helps our Group companies to lend responsibly. If you submit an application and it is declined through this automated process, you can contact us within 21 days to have the decision reconsidered. You also have the right to ask that the decision is not made based solely using a credit scoring system.\\r\\nHow we use credit reference agencies\\r\\nCredit Reference Agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information about consumers\\' and businesses\\' credit behaviour. This includes Electoral Register, fraud prevention, and credit information - including details of previous applications and the conduct of your accounts - and public information such as County Court Judgements, decrees, and bankruptcies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information that Lloyds Banking Group companies and other organisations provide to credit reference agencies about you, your financial associates and your business (if you have one) may be provided to other organisations and used by them and us to:\\r\\n(a) help make decisions, for example when:\\r\\n   (i) checking details on applications for credit and credit-related or other facilities;\\r\\n   (ii) managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities;\\r\\n   (iii) recovering debt;\\r\\n   (iv) checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance;\\r\\n   (v) checking details of job applicants and employees;\\r\\n(b) detect and prevent crime, fraud and money laundering.\\r\\n(c) check your credit history;\\r\\n(d) verify your identity if you, or someone financially linked with you, applies for services;\\r\\n(e) trace your whereabouts; and\\r\\n(f) undertake research, statistical analysis and systems testing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a Lloyds Banking Group company needs to make a credit decision when you apply for a credit-based product or service (e.g. mortgage, personal loan, credit card, or current account) or to review the amount of credit it provides under an existing agreement, such as an overdraft, your records will be searched, along with those of anyone who is financially associated with you such as your spouse or partner. The CRA will keep a record of this search and place a \"footprint\" on your credit file, whether or not the application proceeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may give details of your account and how you conduct it to credit reference agencies, including if you borrow and do not repay in full and on time. If you fall behind with your payments and a full payment or satisfactory proposals are not received within 28 days of a formal demand being issued, then a default notice may be recorded with the CRAs. Similar information may also be given about your other lending/credit relationships with members of the group. Any records shared with CRAs will remain on file for 6 years after your account is closed, whether it has been settled by you or as a result of a default. Other organisations may see these searches and updates if you apply for credit in the future, and these may affect your ability to borrow from other lenders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you apply for or hold an account in joint names, or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, a financial association will be created between your records, including any previous and subsequent names used by you. This means that your financial affairs may be treated as affecting each other. These links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner is successful in applying for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link. You must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose information about them. Searches may be made on all joint applicants, and search footprints will be left on all applicants\\x92 records.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have a right to apply to the credit reference agencies for a copy of your file.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe carry out most of our credit searches using Experian, but details of how you have run your account(s) may be disclosed to all the credit reference agencies. The information they hold may not be the same and there is a small fee that you may need to pay to each agency that you apply to.  Their addresses are:\\r\\n\\r\\nExperian Consumer Help Service, PO Box 9000, Nottingham NG80 7WP or call 0344 481 8000 or log on to www.experian.co.uk\\r\\n\\r\\nEquifax plc, Credit File Advice Centre, PO Box 1140, Bradford BD1 5US or log on to www.equifax.co.uk\\r\\n\\r\\nCallCredit, Consumer Services Team, PO Box 491, Leeds LS3 1WZ or call 0870 060 1414 or log on to www.callcredit.co.uk\\r\\nUsing fraud prevention agencies\\r\\nWe have systems that protect our customers and ourselves against fraud and other crime. Customer information can be used to prevent crime and trace those responsible. We will share your personal information from your application with fraud prevention agencies. If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details of this fraud will be passed to these agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:\\r\\n\\r\\nChecking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities.\\r\\nManaging credit and credit related accounts or facilities.\\r\\nRecovering debt.\\r\\nChecking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance.\\r\\nChecking details of job applicants and employees.\\r\\nPlease contact us on 0345 602 7174 if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.\\r\\nHow we check your identity\\r\\nWe may ask you to provide physical forms of identity verification when you open your account.  Alternatively, we may search credit reference agency files in assessing your application. The agency also gives us other details and information from the Electoral Register to verify your identity.  The agency keeps a record of our search, whether or not your application proceeds.  Our search is not seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.\\r\\nUndertaking Anti-Money Laundering checks\\r\\nTo comply with money laundering regulations, there are times when we need to confirm (or reconfirm) the name and address of our customers. This information may be shared with other group companies. For more details about identity checks, please refer to What proof of identity can I use?\\r\\nObtaining information about you, and other personal details\\r\\nWhen you apply for a mortgage or further borrowing it may be necessary to obtain references, details of your existing financial commitments, and any other information that is required to assess or review lending risks, to recover debts, and to prevent or detect fraud. Where applicable, your current and previous employers, accountant, landlord, lender, bank, insurance or pension company may be contacted to obtain this information. In limited circumstances these references may need to be obtained after you open your account. This may be for regulatory purposes, or if the lending decision needs to be reviewed. Your permission to obtain these references will therefore continue to apply after your account has been opened. It may also be necessary to obtain information or documentation from your solicitor relating to any work they carry out either on your or our behalf.\\r\\nUsing your details for service contact\\r\\nMaking sure we deliver excellent customer service is very important to us and to do this various methods of communication may be used when sending you information about your account. Most of the time you will be contacted by letter or telephone, but you may also be sent updates by text message or email when it is believed to be appropriate. You can ask us to stop sending these messages at any time. Additionally, in extraordinary circumstances (such as natural disaster or civil unrest) we may also send you updates by text message or email. If we decide to use email to contact you, we will only do this if we have ensured that using email will not put your information at risk, or, if you have requested we email you, that we have explained the risks of sending an \"insecure\" email and that you are happy to accept that risk.\\r\\nIn addition you may wish to choose a channel of communication that suits you when you need to contact us.   If you need to email a Lloyds Banking Group company, we recommend you check their website to see if a secure email facility exists so that your email can be sent securely.  If you send us emails in other ways, such as from your personal account, then remember that the message may not be secure and there is a risk that it could be intercepted.  If you choose to send an \"insecure\" email, please keep the amount of confidential information you include to a minimum.\\r\\nRecording phone calls\\r\\nWe may monitor or record phone calls with you in case we need to check we have carried out your instructions correctly, to resolve queries or issues, for regulatory purposes, to help improve our quality of service, and to help detect or prevent fraud or other crimes.  Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.\\r\\nUsing information on social networking sites\\r\\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to understanding our customers better, we may research comments and opinions made public on social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.\\r\\nObtaining a copy of your information\\r\\nUnder the Data Protection Act you have the right of access to your personal data. The Act allows us to charge a fee of \\xa310 for this service. If anything is inaccurate or incorrect, please let us know and we will correct it. For further details on how to request a copy of your information, please write to the:\\r\\n\\r\\nDSAR Unit\\r\\nLloyds Bank\\r\\nCustomer Service Recovery\\r\\nCharlton Place, C57\\r\\nAndover, SP10 1RE\\r\\nUsing your personal information to contact you about products and services\\r\\nUnless you have asked us not to, we and other Lloyds Banking Group companies may contact you by mail, telephone, email or text message about products and services available from the Group. In addition we may also contact you about products and services from selected companies outside the Group, which we believe may be of interest to you or benefit you financially.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe promise not to contact you about everything - only if we think it could be appropriate and relevant to you, such as preferential savings opportunities, account upgrades or special offers.

If you have any concern about privacy at Alexa, please [contact us] with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Website Terms of Use will change also. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.\\r\\nExamples of Information Collected\\r\\n \\r\\nInformation You Give Us\\r\\n\\r\\nYou provide most such information when you use our website or the Toolbar Service. For instance, if you register for an account at Alexa, we collect your name, email address, country of origin, and, if you choose, your nickname, telephone number, website, company, and title. If you download and install the Toolbar Service software, which provides the Alexa toolbar, we collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the installation and registration process, which can include demographic information such as gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and country. Demographic information is correlated to Web usage information collected during your use of the Toolbar Service. In addition, you might provide us with personally identifiable information when you communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise or complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form.\\r\\n \\r\\nAutomatic Information We Collect From the Toolbar Service\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you download the Toolbar Service, and at times during your use of the Alexa website and Toolbar Service, we transmit Alexa cookies to the hard drive of your computer. In addition, for every Web page you view while using the Toolbar Service, the Alexa software transmits and stores your IP address, which may include a domain name, the full URL of the Web page you are visiting, general information about your browser; general information about your computer\\'s operating system; your Alexa cookie number or other identifying alphanumerical information enabling Alexa to identify your computer; and the date and time the above information is logged. All of this above information is logged together in a single data string for each Web page you visit. Each string is logged in our database in the chronological order received from our millions of users. The Toolbar Service also automatically collects information about the online advertisements that are displayed on the websites you visit - specifically, the text, source, and URL of the online ad - and the terms you choose when you use search engines to search the Web. You may disable the Toolbar Service from sending Alexa any web page, advertisement, or search term information by turning off all Web Information features listed in the Options menu in the Toolbar Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexa also periodically collects usage statistics from Toolbar Service users that describe the frequency of use of each Toolbar Service feature. You may disable the Toolbar Service from sending Alexa usage statistics information at any time by using the Options menu in the Toolbar Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, to ensure accurate information about the number of Toolbar Service users, the Toolbar Service periodically sends a signal to Alexa containing basic information such as the IP address of your computer.\\r\\n \\r\\nAutomatic Information We Collect From Our Website\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of the information we collect and analyze when you use our website include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie; web pages you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call us. During some visits to our website we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.\\r\\n \\r\\nAutomatic Information We Collect From Other Websites\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of automatic information we collect from third-party websites include the account identifier for the website, the URL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of web pages visited, any referring URL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to the visited web pages, the IP addresses and browser user-agents of visitors, and a unique identifier for each visitor.\\r\\n \\r\\nInformation from Other Sources\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of information we might receive from other sources is when you authorize a third party website , such as Facebook, to interact directly with the Toolbar Service or our website to provide or receive personalized information about you. In that case, we might receive such information as your name and potentially other information used by that third party website to identify your account with that website.\\r\\n', b\"Privacy Policy\\r\\nWhat does this privacy policy cover?\\r\\nWho is responsible for the personal information collected on this site?\\r\\nSpecial Notice - if you are under 13 years old\\r\\nPurposes of the collection of your data\\r\\nCollection of non-personal information\\r\\nInteraction between you and us\\r\\nKeeping our records accurate\\r\\nSecurity of your personal data\\r\\nUse of your personal information submitted to other web sites\\r\\nCookies policy\\r\\nChanges to this policy\\r\\nHow you can contact us\\r\\nWe respect the privacy of everyone who visits this website.

We value the ongoing trust you have\\r\\nin us to protect your privacy.\\r\\nPersonal information is information or an opinion about you.\\r\\nThis Privacy Policy explains how ANZ will manage and protect\\r\\nyour personal information, including information that ANZ\\r\\ncollects during the course of providing a product or service to\\r\\nyou and the information ANZ holds after your product or\\r\\nservice is terminated (where we are required to hold this\\r\\ninformation or it is necessary for our functions). This Privacy\\r\\nPolicy also applies to information that ANZ collects from third\\r\\nparties including the information ANZ receives through the\\r\\ncredit reporting system. You can find specific information\\r\\nabout ANZ\\x92s credit reporting practices on page 11.\\r\\nThis Privacy Policy contains information about how you can\\r\\naccess the information ANZ holds about you (page 16), how\\r\\nyou can ask ANZ to correct your information (page 17) and\\r\\nhow you can make a complaint if you have concerns about\\r\\nhow ANZ has managed your information (page 18).\\r\\nWhich ANZ entities does this Policy cover?\\r\\nAll ANZ entities are subject to strict standards in relation to the\\r\\nhandling of personal information, regardless of where those\\r\\nentities are located.\\r\\nThis Privacy Policy applies specifically to Australia and New\\r\\nZealand Banking Group Limited and each of its wholly-owned\\r\\nAustralian subsidiaries (ANZ). It explains how your personal\\r\\ninformation is managed in our Australian-based businesses\\r\\nincluding ANZ, Esanda, E*TRADE and OnePath.\\r\\nThe section on Credit Reporting also constitutes the credit\\r\\nreporting Privacy Policy for the following offshore related\\r\\nentities which conduct operational, technology and customer\\r\\nservice functions on behalf of Australian-based ANZ businesses:\\r\\n ANZ Support Services India Private Limited (India)\\r\\n\\x95 ANZ Operations and Technology Private Limited (India)\\r\\n\\x95 ANZ Global Services and Operations (Manila), Inc. (The\\r\\nPhilippines)\\r\\n\\x95 ANZ Pacific Operations Limited (Fiji)\\r\\n\\x95 ANZ Global Services and Operations (Chengdu) Company\\r\\nLimited (China)\\r\\nHow to contact ANZ\\r\\nIf you have any questions or would like more information about\\r\\nthis Privacy Policy you may contact the person, department or\\r\\nbranch that you normally deal with. Alternatively, you may call\\r\\nthe ANZ Australian Contact Centre on 13 13 14 at any time or\\r\\nemail your question or request to yourfeedback@anz.com.\\r\\nOur privacy framework\\r\\nANZ is bound by the Privacy Act and the 13 Australian Privacy\\r\\nPrinciples (APPs) set out in that Act. The APPs regulate the way\\r\\nthat certain entities handle personal information.\\r\\nAs a participant in the credit reporting system, ANZ is also\\r\\nbound by the rules in the Privacy Act which apply to credit\\r\\nreporting. More information about ANZ\\x92s credit reporting\\r\\npractices can be found on page 11.\\r\\nThe Privacy Act does not apply to the handling of information\\r\\nthat does not relate to individuals \\x96 for instance information\\r\\nabout corporations. \\r\\nCOLLECTING YOUR PERSONAL\\r\\nINFORMATION\\r\\nANZ collects your personal information so that we can perform\\r\\nour various functions and activities. ANZ also collects your\\r\\npersonal information if the law requires us to collect it.\\r\\nIf ANZ does not collect your personal information, we may\\r\\nnot be able to deal with you, or provide you with a product\\r\\nor service.\\r\\nANZ collects most personal information directly from you. For\\r\\nexample, you provide us with your information when you open\\r\\nan account, fill in an application form, deal with us over the\\r\\ntelephone, send us a letter, use our websites or visit a branch.\\r\\nIf you apply for one of ANZ\\x92s products or services, ANZ may\\r\\ncollect and hold information from you such as your name,\\r\\naddress, telephone number, e-mail address, tax file number\\r\\n(TFN), date of birth, annual income and other financial details,\\r\\nplace of work, credit history, and your transaction history.\\r\\nCollecting information from third parties\\r\\nANZ may also collect information about you that is publicly\\r\\navailable, including information from telephone directories, the\\r\\nelectoral roll or other websites.\\r\\nThere may be occasions when ANZ collects personal\\r\\ninformation about you from a third party. For example, ANZ may\\r\\ncollect personal information from:\\r\\n\\x95 credit reporting bodies if we request a report about your\\r\\ncredit history (more information about ANZ\\x92s Credit\\r\\nReporting practices can be found on page 11);\\r\\n\\x95 other credit providers if we request information from\\r\\nthem about the products they provide to you;\\r\\n\\x95 organisations that ANZ has an arrangement with to\\r\\njointly offer products and/or has an alliance with to\\r\\nshare information for marketing purposes to provide\\r\\nyou with products or services and/or to promote a product\\r\\nor service;\\r\\n\\x95 our related entities so we can better manage your\\r\\nrelationship with all ANZ companies;\\r\\n\\x95 marketing companies if we acquire contact information\\r\\nto tell people about ANZ products and services that may\\r\\ninterest them; and\\r\\n\\x95 brokers and other parties who may have introduced\\r\\nyou to ANZ.\\r\\nANZ may also collect information about how you use ANZ\\x92s and\\r\\nother websites to help us better tailor our services to you. For\\r\\nexample, ANZ may do this when you click on a link from an ANZ\\r\\nwebsite or visit a website which displays an ANZ advertisement.\\r\\nUsually, the information we collect in this way is general\\r\\ninformation only derived from cookies \\x96 such as the number of\\r\\nvisitors to a site or statistics about how a site is browsed \\x96 and\\r\\ndoes not identify you. If ANZ does identify you with this\\r\\ninformation (for example, if you have been logged onto an\\r\\nonline ANZ service), any use or disclosure of that information will\\r\\nbe in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\\r\\nCollecting sensitive information\\r\\nSensitive information is personal information about a person\\x92s\\r\\nracial or ethnic origin, political opinion, membership of a\\r\\npolitical association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical\\r\\nbeliefs, membership of a professional or trade association,\\r\\nmembership of a trade union, sexual orientation or practices,\\r\\ncriminal record, genetic information or health information.\\r\\nANZ will not collect, use or disclose sensitive information about\\r\\nyou unless we need the information for one of our functions or\\r\\nactivities and we have your consent (or we are legally required\\r\\nto do so).\\r\\nFor example, ANZ\\x92s OnePath business collects health\\r\\ninformation from you and your medical practitioner with your\\r\\nconsent to assess your application for life insurance, to\\r\\nadminister your policy and assess any claim made under that\\r\\npolicy. OnePath may also collect information about you if your\\r\\nfamily members apply for products such as OnePath\\x92s life\\r\\ninsurance or trauma and disablement cover.\\r\\nOnePath may also collect sensitive information through\\r\\ncustomer surveys or questionnaires so that it may obtain your\\r\\nfeedback and provide further information to you about\\r\\nOnePath products or services. More information about ANZ\\x92s\\r\\nmarketing practices can be found on page 15.\\r\\nCollecting information required by law\\r\\nANZ may collect information from you because we are\\r\\nrequired or authorised by an Australian law or court or tribunal\\r\\norder to collect that information. We will tell you if collection is\\r\\nrequired or authorised by law and provide you with details of\\r\\nthe law, court or tribunal order.\\r\\nFor example, when you open a deposit account or take out a\\r\\nloan, ANZ is required under the Anti-Money Laundering and\\r\\nCounter-Terrorism Financing Act to collect certain information\\r\\nfrom you to prove your identity, such as your driver\\x92s licence or\\r\\npassport details. Further, when you provide a mortgage in favour of ANZ, in most States and Territories ANZ is required under Land\\r\\nTitles legislation or rules of the Registrar to verify your identity\\r\\nand this may require the collection of information. ANZ may\\r\\ncollect information to verify your identity even in the limited\\r\\ncircumstances where the collection is not yet required by law.\\r\\nANZ may collect your Australian tax file number (TFN) when\\r\\nyou open a deposit account. It is not compulsory to provide\\r\\nyour TFN, but if you do not, ANZ may deduct withholding tax\\r\\nfrom your interest payments at the highest marginal rate. ANZ\\r\\nwill only collect your TFN to determine whether you are\\r\\nsubject to withholding tax on any interest payments you\\r\\nreceive and for no other purpose. ANZ\\x92s OnePath business is\\r\\nauthorised by the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act\\r\\n1993 to request that you provide your TFN. If ANZ collects your\\r\\nTFN, we will handle your TFN in accordance with the Privacy\\r\\nAct and the TFN Rule issued by the Commissioner.\\r\\nThe National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2010 requires credit\\r\\nproviders like ANZ to make inquiries into the financial situation,\\r\\nneeds and objectives of individuals who apply for consumer\\r\\ncredit. This is to ensure the credit provider has the information -\\r\\nsuch as the individual\\x92s financial commitments, income and\\r\\nliabilities - to make an informed decision about whether the\\r\\nindividual can afford the credit they are applying for.\\r\\nANZ may also be required to ask about your tax residency status\\r\\nunder taxation information sharing agreements the Australian\\r\\nGovernment has in place with other countries. For example, a\\r\\ntax treaty between Australia and the United States formed under\\r\\nUS law (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) requires ANZ to\\r\\nask account holders of some types of products whether they are\\r\\nUS citizens or US tax residents when they open their product. If\\r\\nyou are a tax resident of another country, the relevant treaty or\\r\\nlaw may require us to collect your relevant foreign tax\\r\\nidentification number.\\r\\nUSING YOUR PERSONAL\\r\\nINFORMATION\\r\\nWe may use and disclose personal information we collect\\r\\nabout you for several purposes including:\\r\\n\\x95 to consider your request for a product or service;\\r\\n\\x95 to enable ANZ to provide a product or service;\\r\\n\\x95 to tell you about other products and services that may be\\r\\nof interest to you;to assist in arrangements with other organisations (such as\\r\\nloyalty partners) in relation to the promotion or provision of\\r\\na product or service;\\r\\n\\x95 to manage accounts and perform other administrative\\r\\nand operational tasks (including risk management,\\r\\nsystems development and testing, credit scoring and\\r\\nstaff training, collecting debts and market or customer\\r\\nsatisfaction research);\\r\\n\\x95 to consider any concerns or complaints you raise against ANZ\\r\\nand/or to manage any legal action between you and ANZ;\\r\\n\\x95 to prevent or investigate any actual or suspected fraud,\\r\\nunlawful activity or misconduct;\\r\\n\\x95 to identify you or establish your tax status under any\\r\\nAustralian or foreign legislation, regulation or treaty\\r\\npursuant to an agreement with any tax authority; and\\r\\n\\x95 as required by relevant laws, regulations, codes\\r\\nof practice and external payment systems.\\r\\nDISCLOSING YOUR PERSONAL\\r\\nINFORMATION OVERSEAS\\r\\nANZ may need to disclose your information to organisations\\r\\nlocated overseas.\\r\\nThe most common reason for ANZ disclosing information\\r\\noverseas is because we use service providers to perform some\\r\\nfunctions on our behalf, and some of these service providers\\r\\nare located overseas. We only disclose your information to\\r\\nthese organisations when it is necessary for the services they\\r\\nprovide ANZ.\\r\\nFor the most part, these service providers are related entities of\\r\\nANZ which perform a range of technology, operational and\\r\\ncustomer service functions for ANZ.\\r\\nThese entities are located in the following countries:\\r\\n\\x95 The Philippines\\r\\n\\x95 China\\r\\n\\x95 India\\r\\n\\x95 Fiji\\r\\n\\x95 New Zealand\\r\\nANZ may also use other offshore service providers to help\\r\\nprovide you with our products and services or identify ways to\\r\\nimprove our service to you.\\r\\nIf you apply for a Home Loan with ANZ, receive an A-Z Review\\r\\nof your banking needs, discuss ANZ\\x92s Simple Wealth products\\r\\nwith our Branch Staff, or have a conversation with our Contact\\r\\nCentre staff or one of our ANZ Financial Planners, ANZ may\\r\\nsend you an automated follow up request for your feedback\\r\\non your experience(s). ANZ uses external service providers\\r\\nbased in the USA, Canada and the UK to help us send you the\\r\\nautomated request and to analyse responses. We will therefore\\r\\nneed to send your information to these locations.\\r\\nWhen we provide you with a home loan, and it is a loan which\\r\\nrequires ANZ to take out Lenders\\x92 Mortgage Insurance (LMI),\\r\\nANZ will disclose your information to an administrator with\\r\\ndata storage facilities in the United States.\\r\\nWhen we attempt to verify your identity electronically, ANZ\\r\\nuses an external service provider with operations in Canada,\\r\\nIndia and the Philippines to manage the process of matching\\r\\nyour identity with external data sources. ANZ sends your\\r\\ninformation to an Australian data storage facility and it may be\\r\\naccessed by our service provider from these overseas locations\\r\\nin order to perform services for ANZ.\\r\\nIn addition to service providers, ANZ may also disclose your\\r\\ninformation to our overseas related businesses for the\\r\\npurposes explained in our Privacy Policy. For example, we may\\r\\ndisclose your information to our Singapore business if you\\r\\nopen an account with ANZ in Singapore.\\r\\nWhen we disclose your information overseas, we are required\\r\\nto take measures to ensure your information is treated in\\r\\naccordance with the standards that apply in Australia except in\\r\\nrare cases (for example, where we are required by law to\\r\\ndisclose your information overseas) or unless where we obtain\\r\\nyour consent not to take these measures.\\r\\nThe above is not a complete list of the countries to which your\\r\\ninformation may be disclosed when using an ANZ product or\\r\\nservice. In some circumstances, the nature of the product or\\r\\nservice you request may require ANZ to disclose your information\\r\\noverseas and the countries to which we may disclose your\\r\\ninformation will depend on the particular circumstances. For\\r\\nexample, if you request to transfer funds to an overseas account\\r\\nusing a telegraphic transfer, ANZ will be required to disclose your\\r\\ninformation to one or more overseas banks that are involved in\\r\\nmaking the payment. The location of these banks depends on\\r\\nwhere you want to send your funds.\\r\\nIf ANZ discloses information that we have received through the\\r\\ncredit reporting system to ANZ\\x92s operational hubs, they will use\\r\\nand disclose that consistent with ANZ\\x92s credit reporting practices\\r\\ndescribed in the section titled Credit Reporting below.\\r\\nCREDIT REPORTING\\r\\nAbout credit reporting\\r\\nANZ participates in the credit reporting system. If you apply for\\r\\ncredit from ANZ, we may request a credit report about you\\r\\nfrom a credit reporting body. These credit reports contain\\r\\ninformation which assists us to assess your application,\\r\\nincluding information about your credit history with other\\r\\ncredit providers. Credit reporting bodies can provide credit\\r\\nproviders with credit reports in certain circumstances,\\r\\nincluding when an individual makes an application for credit,\\r\\nor when a credit provider is seeking to help an individual avoid\\r\\ndefaulting on their credit. Credit reports are designed to assist\\r\\ncredit providers to accurately assess an individual\\x92s ability to\\r\\nrepay credit.\\r\\nTo request a credit report, ANZ will provide information to the\\r\\ncredit reporting body that identifies you, as well as information\\r\\nabout your application \\x96 including the type and amount of\\r\\ncredit you are applying for.\\r\\nIn addition to collecting information about your credit history\\r\\nfrom a credit reporting body, we also collect this type of\\r\\ninformation through your use of ANZ products. For instance,\\r\\nwe collect information about the credit you hold through ANZ\\r\\nand how you make repayments on those credit products. We\\r\\ncollect this information to help manage the product you hold\\r\\nwith ANZ. For example, ANZ may use this information to\\r\\ndetermine whether you need assistance to meet your\\r\\nrepayment obligations.\\r\\nSome of this information about the credit you hold with ANZ is\\r\\ndisclosed to a credit reporting body so it can be included in\\r\\nyour credit report and shared with other credit providers that\\r\\nparticipate in the credit reporting system.\\r\\nANZ will also need to assess your eligibility if you nominate to\\r\\nbe a guarantor for another person. This may involve ANZ\\r\\nobtaining information about you from a credit reporting body\\r\\nand reviewing information we already hold about you.\\r\\nOccasionally, ANZ may collect your credit information directly\\r\\nfrom other credit providers, including other banks. ANZ will\\r\\ncollect information from other credit providers with your\\r\\nconsent or if that credit provider and ANZ are jointly providing\\r\\ncredit to you.\\r\\nDisclosing your information to Credit Reporting Bodies\\r\\nUnder the Privacy Act, credit providers can disclose certain\\r\\ninformation about your credit history to credit reporting\\r\\nbodies. ANZ participates in credit reporting so that ANZ is able to obtain information to make better and more informed\\r\\ndecisions about providing credit to individuals. The Privacy Act\\r\\nrestricts the purpose for which credit providers can access and\\r\\nuse information that is held by credit reporting bodies.\\r\\nANZ may disclose the following information about your credit\\r\\nto credit reporting bodies:\\r\\n\\x95 that ANZ provides you credit;\\r\\n\\x95 the type of credit you hold;\\r\\n\\x95 the amount of credit provided to you;\\r\\n\\x95 the terms and conditions of your credit; and\\r\\n\\x95 when your credit account is opened and closed.\\r\\nWe may also disclose how you repay your credit. If you fail to\\r\\nmake repayments on your credit or you default on your\\r\\nobligations, ANZ may report this information to a credit\\r\\nreporting body. Equally, ANZ will inform a credit reporting\\r\\nbody if you make repayments on time or if you have corrected\\r\\na default.\\r\\nWe may also tell a credit reporting body if you commit a\\r\\nserious infringement (for example, fraudulent behaviour or\\r\\ndeliberately seeking to evade your repayment obligations).\\r\\nANZ discloses information to the following credit reporting\\r\\nbodies:\\r\\nVeda Advantage Information Services and\\r\\nSolutions Limited\\r\\nPhone: 1300 850 211\\r\\nMail: Veda Information Services & Solutions Ltd\\r\\nPO Box 964\\r\\nNorth Sydney NSW 2059\\r\\nE-mail: Membership.query@veda.com.au\\r\\nWeb: www.mycreditfile.com.au\\r\\nDun and Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd\\r\\nPhone: 1300 734 806\\r\\nE-mail: PACAustral@dnb.com.au\\r\\nWeb: www.checkyourcredit.com.au\\r\\nExperian Australia Credit Services Pty Ltd\\r\\nPhone: 1300 784 134\\r\\nMail: Experian Australia Credit Services Pty Ltd\\r\\nPO Box 1969\\r\\nNorth Sydney NSW 2060\\r\\nWeb: www.experian.com.au/credit-services/credit-services.\\r\\nhtml\\r\\nEach of these credit reporting bodies is required to have a\\r\\npolicy to explain how it manages your personal information.\\r\\nYou can contact these credit reporting bodies directly to\\r\\nrequest a copy of their privacy policy or for more information\\r\\nabout the way they manage your personal information.\\r\\nUsing information collected through the credit\\r\\nreporting system\\r\\nIf ANZ collects credit information about you through the credit\\r\\nreporting system, ANZ will use that information for several\\r\\npurposes, including:\\r\\n\\x95 to assess your application for credit;\\r\\n\\x95 to assist you to avoid defaulting on your credit obligations;\\r\\n\\x95 to assess your suitability to act as a guarantor;\\r\\n\\x95 to manage accounts and carry out general administration\\r\\nand operational tasks for ANZ\\r\\nGroup (for example, risk management,\\r\\ndevelopment of systems, systems testing, market and\\r\\ncustomer satisfaction research, staff training, credit scoring\\r\\nand collecting debts); and\\r\\n\\x95 as required by relevant laws, regulations, codes of practice\\r\\nand payment systems.\\r\\nANZ will often combine the information obtained from a credit\\r\\nreporting body with information ANZ already holds about you.\\r\\nFor instance, when ANZ assesses your application for credit, we\\r\\nmay combine information about other products you hold\\r\\n(including how much you hold on deposit and how you have\\r\\nrepaid existing ANZ credit), the information you provide on your\\r\\napplication form and the credit report we obtain from a credit\\r\\nreporting body to calculate a rating or score, which will determine\\r\\nwhether you qualify for the credit you are applying for.\\r\\nDisclosing your credit information\\r\\nWhen you apply for credit with ANZ, we seek your consent to\\r\\ndisclose your personal information, including the information\\r\\nwe receive through the credit reporting system, to third\\r\\nparties. The terms and conditions of your product or service\\r\\nwill identify who ANZ discloses your information to. \\r\\nANZ may disclose information it receives through the credit\\r\\nreporting system to related entities of ANZ (who use and disclose\\r\\nthe information in the same way), agents and contractors or\\r\\nservice providers (such as debt collection agencies), other credit\\r\\nproviders (for them to assess credit or investigate suspected\\r\\nfraud), mortgage insurers and your guarantors. ANZ may also\\r\\ndisclose this information when required or authorised to do so by\\r\\nlaw including when ANZ is required to disclose this information to\\r\\nregulatory bodies, government agencies and law enforcement\\r\\nbodies or courts.\\r\\nFraud\\r\\nIf you believe you have been, or are likely to be, a victim of fraud\\r\\n(for example, because you discover someone else is applying\\r\\nfor credit in your name), you have a right to request credit\\r\\nreporting bodies not to use or disclose credit reports they hold\\r\\nabout you. You can do this by contacting them directly.\\r\\nIf you make such a request, a credit reporting body will not\\r\\ndisclose information about you for 21 days.

The policy covers National Australia Bank Ltd ABN 12 004 044 937 and all its related companies (the \\x91Group\\x92), which includes all of our banking, financing, funds management, financial planning, superannuation, insurance, broking and e-commerce organisations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Policy also includes our credit reporting policy, that is, it covers additional information on how we manage your personal information collected in connection with a credit application, or a credit facility. We refer to this credit-related information below as credit information.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypes of personal information we collect\\r\\nWhat personal information do we collect and hold?\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information\\r\\n\\r\\nThe types of information that we collect and hold about you could include:\\r\\n\\r\\nID information such as your name, postal or email address, telephone numbers, and date of birth\\r\\nother contact details such as social media handles\\r\\nfinancial details such as your tax file number\\r\\nhealth information\\r\\ncredit information such as details relating to credit history, credit capacity, and eligibility for credit (\\x91creditworthiness\\x92), and\\r\\nother information we think is necessary.\\r\\nTypes of credit information we collect\\r\\nInformation from a credit reporting body\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we\\x92re checking your creditworthiness and at other times, we might collect information about you from and give it to credit reporting bodies. This information can include:\\r\\n\\r\\nID information: a record of your name(s) (including an alias or previous name), date of birth, gender, current or last known address and previous two addresses, name of current or last known employer and driver's licence number.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation request: a record of a lender asking a credit reporting body for information in relation to a credit application, including the type and amount of credit applied for.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefault information: a record of your consumer credit1 payments being overdue.\\r\\n\\r\\nSerious credit infringement: a record of when a lender reasonably believes that there has been a fraud relating to your consumer credit or that you have avoided paying your consumer credit payments and the credit provider can\\x92t find you.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal insolvency information: a record relating to your bankruptcy or your entry into a debt agreement or personal insolvency agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourt proceedings information: an Australian court judgment relating to your credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublicly available information: a record relating to your activities in Australia and your creditworthiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer credit liability information: certain details relating to your consumer credit, such as the name of the credit provider, whether the credit provider has an Australian Credit Licence, the type of consumer credit, the day on which the consumer credit was entered into and terminated, the maximum amount of credit available and certain repayment terms and conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepayment history information: a record of whether or not you\\x92ve made monthly consumer credit payments and when they were paid.2\\r\\n\\r\\nPayment information: if a lender gave a credit reporting body default information about you and the overdue amount is paid, a statement that the payment has been made.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew arrangement information: if a lender gave a credit reporting body default information about you and your consumer credit contract is varied or replaced, a statement about this.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe base some things on the information we get from credit reporting bodies such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nour summaries of what the credit reporting bodies tell us, and\\r\\ncredit scores. A credit score is a calculation that lets us know how likely a credit applicant will repay credit we may make available to them.\\r\\nInformation that we get from a credit reporting body, or information we derive from such information is known as credit eligibility information.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat sensitive information do we collect?\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes we need to collect sensitive information3 about you, for instance in relation to some insurance applications. This could include things like medical checks, medical consultation reports or other information about your health. Unless required by law, we will only collect sensitive information with your consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollection required by Law\\r\\nWhen the law authorises or requires us to collect information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may collect information about you because we are required or authorised by law to collect it. There are laws that affect financial institutions, including company and tax law, which require us to collect personal information. For example, we require personal information to verify your identity under Commonwealth anti-money laundering law.\\r\\n\\r\\nWebsite activity\\r\\nWhat do we collect via your website activity?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\x92re an internet banking customer of ours, we monitor your use of internet banking services to ensure we can verify you and can receive information from us, and to identify ways we can improve our services for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you start but don\\x92t submit an on-line application, we can contact you using any of the contact details you\\x92ve supplied to offer help completing it. The information in applications will be kept temporarily then destroyed if the application is not completed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also know that some customers like to engage with us through social media channels. We may collect information about you when you interact with us through these channels. However for all confidential matters, we\\x92ll ensure we interact with you via a secure forum.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo improve our services and products, we sometimes collect de-identified information from web users. That information could include IP addresses or geographical information to ensure your use of our mobile banking applications is secure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also collect de-identified information if you use one of our Group calculators or other programs. Although the information collected does not identify an individual, it does provide the Group with useful statistics so that we can analyse and improve our web services. For more information on how we use cookies and tracking tags see our Cookies Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow we collect your personal information\\r\\nHow we collect and hold your information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe understand that your personal information needs to be looked after and isn\\x92t something you leave lying around for just anybody to take. So unless it\\x92s unreasonable or impracticable, we will try to collect personal information directly from you (referred to as \\x91solicited information\\x92). For this reason, it\\x92s important that you help us to do this and keep your contact details up-to-date.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many ways we seek information from you. We might collect your information when you fill out a form with us, when you\\x92ve given us a call, used our websites or dropped into one of our branches. We also find using electronic means, such as email or SMS, a convenient way to communicate with you and to verify your details4.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow we collect your information from other sources\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes we collect information about you from other sources. We do this only if it\\x92s necessary to do so. Instances of when we may need to include where:\\r\\n\\r\\nwe can\\x92t get hold of you and we rely on publicly available information to update your contact details\\r\\nwe need information from an insurer about an insurance application you make through us\\r\\nwe are checking the security you are offering through public registers and our service providers, and\\r\\nat your request, we exchange information with your legal or financial advisers or other representatives.\\r\\nConsequences of not providing your personal information\\r\\nWhat if you don\\x92t want to provide us with your personal information?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don\\x92t provide your personal information to us, we may not be able to:\\r\\n\\r\\nprovide you with the product or service you want\\r\\nmanage or administer your product or service\\r\\nverify your identity or protect against fraud, or\\r\\nlet you know about other products or services from across the Group that might better meet your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs.\\r\\nHow we collect your credit information\\r\\nHow we collect and hold your credit information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will collect your credit information from details included in your application for credit (whether paper-based, phone or electronic). In addition to what we say above about collecting information from other sources, other main sources for collecting credit information are:\\r\\n\\r\\ncredit reporting bodies\\r\\nother credit providers\\r\\nyour co-loan applicants or co-borrowers\\r\\nyour guarantors/proposed guarantors\\r\\nyour employer, accountant, real estate agent or other referees\\r\\nyour agents and other representatives like your referrers, brokers, solicitors, conveyancers and settlement agents\\r\\norganisations that help us to process credit applications such as mortgage managers\\r\\norganisations that check the security you are offering such as valuers\\r\\norganisations involved in the securitisation of our loans such as loan servicers, trust managers, trustees and security trustees\\r\\norganisations providing lenders mortgage insurance and title insurance to us or our related lenders\\r\\nbodies that issue identification documents to help us check your identity, and\\r\\nour service providers involved in helping us to provide credit or to administer credit products, including our debt collectors and our legal advisers.\\r\\nUnsolicited personal information\\r\\nWhat do we do when we get information we didn\\x92t ask for?\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause we are a big organisation, people often share information with us we haven\\x92t sought out (referred to as \\x91unsolicited information\\x92). Where we receive unsolicited personal information about you, we'll check whether that information is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities. If it is, we\\x92ll handle this information the same way we do with other information we seek from you. If not, we\\x92ll ensure we do the right thing and destroy or de-identify it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotifying you\\r\\nWhen will we notify you that we have received your information?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we receive personal information from you directly, we\\x92ll take reasonable steps to notify you how and why we collected your information, who we may disclose it to and outline how you can access it, seek correction of it or make a complaint.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes we collect your personal information from third parties. You may not be aware that we have done so. If we collect information that can be used to identify you, we'll take reasonable steps to notify you of that collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking care of your personal information\\r\\nHow do we take care of your personal information?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe store information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form. The security of your personal information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we do this are:\\r\\n\\r\\nconfidentiality requirements of our employees\\r\\ndocument storage security policies\\r\\nsecurity measures for access to our systems\\r\\nonly giving access to personal information to a person who is verified to be able to receive that information\\r\\ncontrol of access to our buildings, and\\r\\nelectronic security systems, such as firewalls and data encryption on our websites.\\r\\nView more information on our online security and how you can protect yourself online.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can store personal information physically or electronically with third party data storage providers. Where we do this, we use contractual arrangements to ensure those providers take appropriate measures to protect that information and restrict the uses to which they can put that information.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happens when we no longer need your information?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\x92ll only keep your information for as long as we require it for our purposes. We\\x92re also required to keep some of your information for certain periods of time under law, such as the Corporations Act, the Anti-Money Laundering & Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, and the Financial Transaction Reports Act for example. When we no longer require your information, we\\x92ll ensure that your information is destroyed or de-identified.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing your personal information\\r\\nWhat are the main reasons we collect, hold and use your information?\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause we offer a range of services and products, collecting your personal information allows us to provide you with the products and services you\\x92ve asked for. This means we can use your information to:\\r\\n\\r\\nprovide you with information about products and services\\r\\nconsider your request for products and services, including your eligibility\\r\\nprocess your application and provide you with products and services, and\\r\\nadminister products and services which includes answering your requests and complaints, varying products and services, taking any required legal action in relation to our accounts and managing our relevant product portfolios.\\r\\nMarketing\\r\\nCan we use your information for marketing our products and services?\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven our wide organisation scope, we think we\\x92ve learnt a lot of things along the way and we\\x92d like to share what we know about our products with you. We may use or disclose your personal information to let you know about products and services from across the Group that might better serve your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs, or run competitions or promotions and other opportunities in which you may be interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may conduct these marketing activities via email, telephone, SMS, iM, mail or any other electronic means. We may also market our products to you through third party channels (such as social networking sites), or based on your use of Group programs. We'll always let you know that you can opt out from receiving our third party or Group program marketing offers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere we market to prospective customers, we're happy to let them know how we obtained their information and will provide easy to follow opt-outs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith your consent, we may disclose your personal information to third parties such as brokers or agents, or for the purpose of connecting you with other businesses or customers. You can ask us not to do this at any time. We won\\x92t sell your personal information to any organisation outside the Group.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, you can opt-out\\r\\n\\r\\nContact us if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing offers from the Group. We'll process your request as soon as practicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the other ways we use your information?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\x92ve just told you some of the main reasons why we collect your information. Other reasons we use your personal information include:\\r\\n\\r\\nidentifying you or verifying your authority to act on behalf of a customer\\r\\ntelling you about other products or services that may be of interest to you, or running competitions and other promotions (this can be via email, telephone, SMS, iM, mail, or any other electronic means including social networking forums\\x97unless you tell us not to)\\r\\nassisting in arrangements with other organisations (such as loyalty partners) in relation to a product or service we make available to you\\r\\nallowing us to run our business and perform administrative and operational tasks such as:\\r\\ntraining staff\\r\\ndeveloping and marketing products and services\\r\\nrisk management\\r\\nsystems development and testing, including our websites and other online channels\\r\\nundertaking planning, research and statistical analysis.\\r\\ndetermining whether a beneficiary will be paid a benefit\\r\\npreventing or investigating any fraud or crime, or any suspected fraud or crime\\r\\nas required by law, regulation or codes binding us, and\\r\\nfor any purpose for which you have given your consent.\\r\\nUsing your credit information\\r\\nHow we use your credit information\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the ways for using personal information mentioned above, we may also use your credit information to:\\r\\n\\r\\nenable a mortgage insurer or title insurer to assess the risk of providing insurance to us, or to address our contractual arrangements with the insurer\\r\\nassess whether to accept a guarantor or the risk of a guarantor being unable to meet their obligations\\r\\nconsider hardship requests, and\\r\\nassess whether to securitise loans and to arrange the securitising of loans.\\r\\nSharing your personal and credit information\\r\\nWho do we share your personal information with?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make sure we can meet your specific needs and for the purposes described in \\x91Using your personal information\\x92, we sometimes need to share your personal information with others. We may share your information with other organisations for any purposes for which we use your information.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing with the Group\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may share your personal information with other Group members. This could depend on the product or service you have applied for and the Group member you are dealing with.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing at your request\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may need to share your personal information with:\\r\\n\\r\\nyour representative or any person acting on your behalf (for example, financial advisers, lawyers, settlement agents, accountants, executors, administrators, trustees, guardians, brokers or auditors), and\\r\\nyour referee such as your employer (to confirm details about you).\\r\\nSharing with Credit Reporting bodies\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may disclose information about you to a credit reporting body if you are applying for credit, or if you've obtained credit from us, or if you guarantee or are considering guaranteeing the obligations of another person to us, or if you are a director of a company that is a loan applicant or borrower or guarantor. When we give your information to a credit reporting body, it may be included in reports that the credit reporting body gives other organisations (such as other lenders) to help them assess your creditworthiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of that information may reflect adversely on your creditworthiness, (for example if you've failed to make payments, or if you've committed a serious credit infringement such as obtaining credit by fraud). That sort of information may affect your ability to get credit from other lenders.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing with third parties\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may disclose your personal information to third parties outside of the Group including:\\r\\n\\r\\nthose involved in providing, managing or administering your product or service\\r\\nauthorised representatives of the Group who sell products or services on our behalf\\r\\nsuperannuation and managed funds organisations (and their advisers)\\r\\nmedical professionals, medical facilities or health authorities who verify any health information you may provide\\r\\nvaluers, insurers (including lenders\\x92 mortgage insurers and title insurers), re-insurers, claim assessors and investigators\\r\\nbrokers or referrers who refer your application or business to us\\r\\nloyalty program partners\\r\\nother financial institutions such as banks\\r\\norganisations involved in debt collecting, including purchasers of debt\\r\\nfraud reporting agencies (including organisations that assist with fraud investigations and organisations established to identify, investigate and/or prevent any fraud, suspected fraud, crime, suspected crime, or misconduct of a serious nature)\\r\\norganisations involved in surveying or registering a security property or whom otherwise have an interest in such property\\r\\nreal estate agents\\r\\ngovernment or regulatory bodies (including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Tax Office) as required or authorised by law (in some instances these bodies may share information with relevant foreign authorities)\\r\\nour accountants, auditors or lawyers and other external advisers\\r\\nrating agencies to the extent necessary to allow the rating agency to rate particular investments\\r\\nany party involved in securitising your facility including re-insurers and underwriters, loan servicers, trust managers, trustees and security trustees\\r\\nguarantors and prospective guarantors of your facility\\r\\norganisations that maintain, review and develop our business systems, procedures and technology infrastructure, including testing or upgrading our computer systems\\r\\norganisations who participate with us in payments systems including merchants, payment organisations, and organisations that produce cards, cheque books or statements for us\\r\\nour joint venture partners who conduct business with us\\r\\norganisations involved in a corporate re-organisation or transfer of Group assets or business\\r\\norganisations who assist with our product planning, research and development\\r\\nmailing houses and telemarketing agencies who assist us to communicate with you\\r\\nother organisations involved in our normal business practices, including our agents and contractors, and\\r\\nwhere you\\x92ve given your consent.\\r\\nOverseas disclosures\\r\\nSharing outside of Australia\\r\\n\\r\\nWe run our business in Australia and overseas. We may need to share some of your information (including credit information) with organisations outside Australia. Sometimes, we may need to ask you before this happens. You can view a list of the countries in which those overseas organisations are located at.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may store your information in cloud or other types of networked or electronic storage. As electronic or networked storage can be accessed from various countries via an internet connection, it\\x92s not always practicable to know in which country your information may be held. If your information is stored in this way, disclosures may occur in countries other than those listed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverseas organisations may be required to disclose information we share with them under a foreign law. In those instances, we will not be responsible for that disclosure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not share any of your credit information with a credit reporting body, unless it has a business operation in Australia. We are not likely to share credit eligibility information (that is, credit information we obtain about you from a credit reporting body or that we derive from that information) with organisations unless they have business operations in Australia. However in the event NAB seeks assistance from a related company to manage defaulting loans, we may need as a consequence disclose credit eligibility information to the Bank of New Zealand, located in New Zealand. We are likely to share other credit information about you with organisations outside Australia. A list of countries in which those overseas organisations are located is set out above.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccessing your personal and credit information\\r\\nHow you generally access your information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\x91ll always give you access to your personal information unless there are legal reasons why we can\\x92t. You can request to see the personal information that we hold by filling out the Personal Information Access form (PDF, 60KB). In some cases we may be able to deal with your request over the phone or in a branch. Contact us if you'd like a copy of the form to be sent out to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'll give you access to your information in the form you want it where it\\x92s reasonable and practical (such as a copy of a phone call you may have had with us which we can put on disk for you). We may charge you a small fee to cover our costs but we\\x92ll always check with you first.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\x92re not always required to give you access to your personal information.

For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.\\r* Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other\\'s APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.\\r2.

Your privacy is important to us and this Privacy Policy reflects our concern in safeguarding it. This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the collection, maintenance, use and sharing of information that we collect. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and those changes will be available for your review on this web site. Your continued use of OneStep Search Desktop after any such changes have been made will signify your assent to the changed Privacy Policy. To contact OneStep about privacy issues, please e-mail us at onestepsearch.privacy@onestepsearch.net.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation We Gather:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not purposefully collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number). OneStep Search Desktop does transmit limited non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP address, type of browser and operating system, unique software ID, version of the OneStep Software, internal software status indicators (including error codes to determine if the Software has encountered any internal errors), a tag that identifies any OneStep distribution partner from whom you may have downloaded or installed OneStep Search Desktop, and keyword and error search queries entered in your browser address bar. Please note that search query information collected by OneStep Search Desktop is maintained by us on an aggregated basis (i.e., together with the queries of all of our end-users) for the purposes of generating statistics regarding the use of our aoftware (such as the number of queries performed by the average end-user per month, a list of the most popular query terms, etc.), and is never used in a manner that matches specific search query information with any particular end-user. To properly reflect your language, filtering and other preferences, OneStep Search Desktop may also use cookies (i.e., packets of information containing your preferences that are sent to your browser and sent back by your browser each time your browser accesses our server). Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server that placed them there. If you wish to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your browser, you should refer to the documentation accompanying your browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow We Use the Information We Gather:\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the limited, non-personally identifiable information collected is used to provide more relevant services to our end-users. For example, we may use your IP address to determine which language to use to provide you with Internet search results. In addition, information collected from end-users may be used in aggregate form to, among other things, determine the total number of distributed and active copies of OneStep Search Desktop, prepare utilization reports for our partners or affiliates (collectively, \"Partners\"), diagnose and fix compatibility problems or other bugs in our software, and perform statistical analyses to enable us to build higher quality, more useful online services. The information collected from end-users also allows us to determine if the software on an end-user\\'s computer is encountering internal errors or needs to be updated and permits us to deliver search results pages that are as responsive as possible to an individual end- user\\'s particular search query ( e.g., serves results in the end-user\\'s native language and tailored to the end-user\\'s country of connectivity).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen We Disclose the Information We Gather:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a general rule, we do not share the information we collect from end-users with third- parties. However, IP addresses, unique software IDs, and search terms or phrases inputted in the browser address bar as queries by our end-users are transmitted to certain Partners with whom OneStep has subcontracted to obtain Internet search results or other services in response to such search queries (such as Yahoo!, AskJeeves.com, Miva and others). The data is also used by those Partners for internal data reporting purposes, but not for the purposes of marketing to our end-users. In addition, some of the information we collect is provided, in aggregate form only, to our Partners solely for purposes of calculating amounts owed to such Partners, not for the purposes of marketing to our end- users. Our Partners are obligated by applicable law to protect the privacy of certain types of data; however, we are not responsible for their actions or omissions, including the manner in which they use information that they receive from us. Nevertheless, if you feel that any of our Partners, or any third party who claims association with OneStep, is improperly collecting or using information about you, we urge you to contact them directly and also to inform us by e-mailing us at onestepsearch.privacy@onestepsearch.net. If in the future we sell or transfer assets or portions of our business, or if we experience a change in control, reorganization or liquidation, we may transfer such information to our successor or buyer, subject to this Privacy Policy. Finally, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you if it is required by law, necessary to defend our legal rights, or if we in good faith believe it is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity in which you may beinvolved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved), even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo Responsibility for Third-Party Practices:\\r\\n\\r\\nAny web sites that you click to from one of our Internet search results web pages have been developed by third-parties over which we exercise no control.

Samsung\\x92s SmartTV services offer features that may enhance video content, customized TV, movie, and other content recommendations, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your SmartTV with gestures and voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your SmartTV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some SmartTV features.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommendations and Customized Content\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SmartTV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programs distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your SmartTV.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of live television programs, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your zip code. In addition, the SmartTV helps make the searchable guides and other SmartTV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you, such as episodes of programs that you may have missed and new programs, applications and other content that we believe you will find of interest. We base these recommendations on:\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your SmartTV or other devices;\\r\\nInformation about applications you have accessed through the SmartTV panels;\\r\\nInformation about your clicks on the \\x93Like,\\x94 \\x93Dislike,\\x94 \\x93Watch Now,\\x94 and other buttons on your SmartTV;\\r\\nThe query terms you enter into SmartTV search features, including when you search for particular video content; and\\r\\nOther SmartTV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, information stored in cookies and similar technologies, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.\\r\\nIn addition, if you enable the collection of information about video streams viewed on your SmartTV, we may collect that information and additional information about the network, channels, and programs that you view through the SmartTV. We will use such information to improve the recommendations that we deliver to you on the SmartTV.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease visit the \\x93settings\\x94 menu of your SmartTV for choices that may be available to you if you do not wish to continue to receive personalized recommendations on your SmartTV. If you disable personalized recommendations, then the information and content displayed on your SmartTV may not be as relevant to you. Samsung may still collect information about your usage of the SmartTV for the purposes described in this Samsung Privacy Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSyncPlus and Interactive Marketing\\r\\n\\r\\nBy enabling SyncPlus or other marketing features, you may make the content and advertising that you receive on your SmartTV and other devices when you are watching SmartTV more interactive. TV programming providers or advertisers can enhance video programs by providing interactive content, such as in-program trivia, show insights, games, and promotions, on your SmartTV or other devices. Similarly, advertisers can enhance their ads by enabling users to take immediate action (e.g., downloading a coupon or app) in response to an ad.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make these kinds of enhancements available, we provide video or audio snippets of the program you\\x92re watching to third-party providers that use this information in order to return content or advertising \\x93synched\\x94 to what you\\x92re watching. These providers may receive information about your device (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers) and your interactions with the content and advertising they provide. You may disable these interactive marketing features at any time by visiting the \\x93settings\\x94 menu. The choices you make with respect to interactive marketing features will not affect whether you receive other types of ads and marketing on your SmartTV.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoice Recognition\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can control your Smart TV, and use many of its features, with voice commands.?? \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some interactive voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service provider (currently, Nuance Communications, Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text and to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you. In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features.  Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands only when you make a specific search request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control. \\r\\n\\r\\n?\\tIf you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use interactive voice recognition features, although you may be able to control your TV using certain predefined voice commands. \\r\\n\\r\\n?\\tYou may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the \\x93settings\\x94 menu. However, this may prevent you from using some of the Voice Recognition features.\\r\\n\\r\\nGesture Controls and Facial Recognition\\r\\n\\r\\nYour SmartTV is equipped with a camera that enables certain advanced features, including the ability to control and interact with your TV with gestures and to use facial recognition technology to authenticate your Samsung Account on your TV. The camera can be covered and disabled at any time, but be aware that these advanced services will not be available if the camera is disabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nGesture Control.To provide you with the ability to control your SmartTV through gestures, the camera mounted on the top of your SmartTV can recognize your movements. This enables you, for example, to move between panels and zoom in or zoom out. We record information about when and how users use gesture controls so that we can evaluate the performance of these controls and improve them. \\r\\n\\r\\nFacial Recognition.The camera situated on the SmartTV also enables you to authenticate your Samsung Account or to log into certain services using facial recognition technology. You can use facial recognition instead of, or as a supplementary security measure in addition to, manually inputting your password. Once you complete the steps required to set up facial recognition, an image of your face is stored locally on your TV; it is not transmitted to Samsung. If you cancel your Samsung Account or no longer desire to use facial recognition, please visit the applicable settings menu to delete the stored image. While your image will be stored locally, Samsung may take note of the fact that you have set up the feature and collect information about when and how the feature is used so that we can evaluate the performance of this feature and improve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFitness Services\\r\\n\\r\\nTo provide you with personalized fitness recommendations, SmartTV services enable you to create a profile that contains certain basic information about yourself, including your height, weight and date of birth. You can delete such a profile at any time by following the directions in the service\\x92s preferences [or settings] screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nKids Services\\r\\n\\r\\nSmartTV services may make available educational videos and other content appropriate for children, but we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird Parties\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third-party, that provider may collect or receive information about your SmartTV (e.g., its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g., your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers\\x92 privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.\\r\\n\\r\\nCountry-Specific Features\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that one or more

b'Welcome to the Google Privacy Policy\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you use Google services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. And remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and security at My Account\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Policy\\r\\nThere are many different ways you can use our services \\x96 to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better \\x96 to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we\\x92re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Privacy Policy explains:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat information we collect and why we collect it.\\r\\nHow we use that information.\\r\\nThe choices we offer, including how to access and update information.\\r\\nWe\\x92ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you\\x92re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices \\x96 and if you have any questions contact us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nInformation we collect\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect information to provide better services to all of our users \\x96 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\\x92ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect information in the following ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we\\x92ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:\\r\\n\\r\\nDevice information\\r\\n\\r\\nWe collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account.\\r\\n\\r\\nLog information\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you use our services or view content provided by Google, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:\\r\\n\\r\\ndetails of how you used our service, such as your search queries.\\r\\ntelephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.\\r\\nInternet protocol address.\\r\\ndevice event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.\\r\\ncookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.\\r\\nLocation information\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnique application numbers\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal storage\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies and similar technologies\\r\\n\\r\\nWe and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites. Our Google Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics information is linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by Google, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation we collect when you are signed in to Google, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your Google Account. When information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as personal information. For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated with your Google Account, visit the Transparency and choice section of this policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nHow we use information we collect\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content \\x96 like giving you more relevant search results and ads.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1\\x92s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we\\x92ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services \\x96 for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nTransparency and choice\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:\\r\\n\\r\\nReview and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you\\x92ve watched on YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Google services. You can also visit these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you use our services while signed-out of your account.\\r\\nReview and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.\\r\\nView and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.\\r\\nAdjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.\\r\\nControl who you share information with through your Google Account.\\r\\nTake information associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.\\r\\nChoose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.\\r\\nYou may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it\\x92s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nInformation you share\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nAccessing and updating your personal information\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it \\x96 unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nInformation we share\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies:\\r\\n\\r\\nWith your consent\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith domain administrators\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:\\r\\n\\r\\nview statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.\\r\\nchange your account password.\\r\\nsuspend or terminate your account access.\\r\\naccess or retain information stored as part of your account.\\r\\nreceive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.\\r\\nrestrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.\\r\\nPlease refer to your domain administrator\\x92s privacy policy for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor external processing\\r\\n\\r\\nWe provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor legal reasons\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\\r\\n\\r\\nmeet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.\\r\\nenforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\\r\\ndetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.\\r\\nprotect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.\\r\\nWe may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \\x96 like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nInformation security\\r\\n\\r\\nWe work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe encrypt many of our services using SSL.\\r\\nWe offer you two step verification when you access your Google Account, and a Safe Browsing feature in Google Chrome.\\r\\nWe review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.\\r\\nWe restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nWhen this Privacy Policy applies\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, services Google provides on Android devices, and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nCompliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities\\r\\n\\r\\nWe regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nChanges\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nSpecific product practices\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following notices explain specific privacy practices with respect to certain Google products and services that you may use:\\r\\n\\r\\nChrome and Chrome OS\\r\\nPlay Books\\r\\nPayments\\r\\nFiber\\r\\nProject Fi\\r\\nGoogle Apps for Education\\r\\nFor more information about some of our most popular services, you can visit the Google Product Privacy Guide.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\nOther useful privacy and security related materials\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther useful privacy and security related materials can be found through Google\\x92s policies and principles pages, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about our technologies and principles, which includes, among other things, more information on\\r\\nhow Google uses cookies.\\r\\ntechnologies we use for advertising.\\r\\nhow we recognize patterns like faces.\\r\\nA page that explains what data is shared with Google when you visit websites that use our advertising, analytics and social products.\\r\\nThe Privacy Checkup tool, which makes it easy to review your key privacy settings.\\r\\nGoogle\\x92s safety center, which provides information on how to stay safe and secure online.', b'Personal information\\r\\nPersonal information is information that can be used to identify you as a specific individual; for example, your name, address, email address or telephone number.

If you tell us that you do not want us to use your information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your request, we will respect your wishes.\\r\\nWe may also collect information relating to your use of our Web sites and SaaS offerings through the use of various technologies. For example, when you visit our Web sites or access our SaaS offerings, we may log certain information that your browser sends us, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring Web site addresses, and we may collect information about the pages you view within our sites and other actions you take while visiting us. In addition, some of our software products include technologies that allow IBM to collect certain information about product use. We may also use such technologies to determine whether you\\'ve opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail. Collecting information in this manner allows us to collect statistics about the usage and effectiveness of our Web sites, our software products and our SaaS offerings, personalize your experience and tailor our interactions with you. For details regarding the technologies we employ, see Cookies, Web Beacon and Other Technologies below.\\r\\nFrom time to time, we may also collect information that pertains to you indirectly through other sources, such as list vendors. When we do so, we ask the vendors to confirm that the information was legally acquired by the third party and that we have the right to obtain it from them and use it.\\r\\nThe information that we collect, either directly or indirectly, may be combined to help us improve its overall accuracy and completeness and to help us better tailor our interactions with you.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of Personal Information\\r\\nThe following paragraphs describe in more detail how IBM may use your personal information.\\r\\nFulfilling your Transaction Request\\r\\nIf you request something from IBM, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, for instance, IBM\\'s business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, or postal or government authorities, such as Customs authorities, involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.\\r\\nPersonalizing your Experience on our Web Sites\\r\\nWe may use information we collect about you to provide you with a personalized experience on our Web sites, such as providing you with content in which you may be interested and making navigation on our sites easier.\\r\\nProviding Support\\r\\nWe may use your personal information to support products or services you have obtained from us, such as notifying you of a product update or fix.\\r\\nWe also provide \\x93Live Chat\\x94 sessions on our Web sites to assist you while you\\x92re navigating through our sites; we will use personal information you provide via these sessions in accordance with this Privacy Statement.\\r\\nIn the course of providing technical support to you, we may sometimes have incidental access to data that you have provided to us or data that is located on your system. This data may contain information about you, your organization\\x92s employees, customers, partners, or suppliers. This Privacy Statement does not apply to our access to or handling of this information; the conditions regarding the handling and processing of that data is covered by the applicable Terms of Use or other agreements between you and IBM, such as the Terms of Use for Exchanging Diagnostic Data.\\r\\nMarketing\\r\\nThe information you provide to IBM, as well as the information we have collected about you indirectly, may be used by IBM for marketing purposes. Before we do so, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. You may at any time choose not to receive marketing materials from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each e-mail you may receive, by indicating so when we call you, or by contacting us directly (please refer to \\x93Privacy Questions and Access\\x94 below).\\r\\nSome of our offerings may be co-branded, that is sponsored by both IBM and third parties.

We encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies to gain an understanding of the manner in which they will handle information about you.\\r\\nIf you choose to \\x93Email This Page\\x94 to a friend or colleague, we will ask for their name and e-mail address. We will automatically send a one-time e-mail sharing the page you indicated, but will not use that information for other purposes.\\r\\nRecruitment\\r\\nIn connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on an IBM Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume. We may use this information throughout IBM in order to address your inquiry or consider you for employment purposes. Unless you tell us not to do so, we may keep the information for future consideration.\\r\\nMonitoring or Recording of Calls, Chats and Other Interactions\\r\\nCertain online transactions may involve you calling us or us calling you. They may also involve online chats. Please be aware that it is IBM\\'s general practice to monitor and in some cases record such interactions for staff training or quality assurance purposes or to retain evidence of a particular transaction or interaction.\\r\\nMobile Applications and Use of Information in the Social Computing Environment\\r\\nIBM makes available mobile applications for download from various mobile application marketplaces. IBM also provides social computing tools on some of its Web sites to enable online sharing and collaboration among members who have registered to use them. These include forums, wikis, blogs and other social media platforms.\\r\\nWhen downloading and using these applications or registering to use these social computing tools, you may be asked to provide certain personal information. Registration information will be subject to and protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement, except for the information that is automatically made available to other participants as part of your profile. These applications and tools may also include supplemental privacy statements with specific information about collection and handling practices. Read those supplemental statements to understand what the tools and applications may do.\\r\\nAny other content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any other type of personal information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms or applications, is not subject to this Privacy Statement. Rather, such content is subject to the Terms of Use of those applications or platforms, and any additional guidelines and privacy information provided in relation to their use, as well as the process by which you can remove your content from such tools or get help to do so. Please refer to them to better understand yours, IBM\\'s, and other parties\\' rights and obligations with regard to such content. You should be aware that the content you post on any such social computing platforms may be made broadly available to others inside and outside IBM.\\r\\nProtect the Rights and Property of IBM and Others\\r\\nWe may also use or share your information to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers, clients, or others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or the rights of others, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web sites.\\r\\nInformation for Business Partners\\r\\nIf you represent an IBM business partner, you may visit IBM Web sites intended specifically for IBM business partners. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the business partner you represent, and IBM business partners generally. For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of IBM business partner programs. It may also include sharing certain information with other business partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or IBM customers or prospects. In connection with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.\\r\\nInformation for Suppliers\\r\\nIf you represent an IBM supplier, you may visit IBM Web sites intended specifically for use by IBM suppliers. We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or performing a transaction with you. For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of IBM, IBM\\'s business partners, customers, shipping companies, financial institutions and postal or government authorities involved in fulfillment. It may also be used to administer and develop our relationship with you, the supplier you represent, and other IBM suppliers generally.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nSharing of Personal Information and International Transfers\\r\\nIBM is a global organization with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share information about you within IBM and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, IBM will still handle your information in the manner described here.\\r\\nIn some cases, IBM uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is IBM\\'s practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with IBM\\'s policies.\\r\\nFrom time to time, we may disclose information that identifies you at an individual level and which we collected on our Web sites to other non-IBM entities that are not acting as our suppliers, such as our business partners. Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we will only do so with your prior consent. We do not sell or lease such information however.\\r\\nCircumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, IBM decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is IBM\\x92s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.\\r\\nPlease be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation Security and Accuracy\\r\\nWe intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its accuracy. IBM implements reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information such as credit card information when we transmit such information over the Internet. We also require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetention\\r\\nWe will retain your registration information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to request that we no longer use your registration information to provide you services contact us at NETSUPP@us.ibm.com. We will retain and use your registration information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies\\r\\nAs mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our Web sites and your use of our SaaS offerings and our software products to help us gather statistics about usage and effectiveness, personalize your experience, and tailor our interactions with you. We do so through the use of various technologies, including scripts, tags, Local Shared Objects (Flash cookies), Local Storage (HTML5) beacons, and one called \"cookies\". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer. While cookies are often only used to measure Web site usage (such as number of visitors and duration of visit) and effectiveness (such as topics visitors are most interested in) and to allow for ease of navigation or use and, as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor\\'s experience to a Web site by being associated with profile information or user preferences. Over time this information provides valuable insight to help improve the user experience.\\r\\nCookies are typically categorized as \"session\" cookies or \"persistent\" cookies. Session cookies help you navigate through the Web site efficiently, keeping track of your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information you have already provided during the current visit. Session cookies are stored in temporary memory and erased when the web browser is closed. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, store user preferences for current and successive visits. They are written on your device\\'s hard disk, and are still valid when you restart your browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location.\\r\\nWhile IBM Web sites at this time do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as \"do not track\" instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies though your web browser. Look under the heading \"Tools\" (or similar heading) in your particular browser for information about controlling cookies. You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies. Cookies in our software products can be turned off in the product itself. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web sites\\' features or features of our software products and SaaS offerings, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block, turn off or otherwise reject our cookies, some Web pages may not display properly or you will not be able, for instance, to add items to your shopping cart, proceed to checkout, or use any Web site services that require you to sign in. Some IBM Web sites, SaaS offerings and software products may also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across IBM\\'s Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don\\'t want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages or use of these products, you can set your browser to turn off cookies or turn off cookies in the product itself, respectively. If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages; however, they will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies.\\r\\nFor more information about the technologies employed by our SaaS offerings and software products, including how to turn them off, please consult the user guide for the particular software product or SaaS offering you are using. For information about how IBM clients may use cookies and other technologies in their own implementation of IBM software products and SaaS offerings, click here.\\r\\nWe use Local Shared Objects, such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display IBM advertising on others\\x92 web sites based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash cookies or HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html\\r\\nWe may also include Web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.\\r\\nSome of our business partners set Web beacons and cookies on our site. In addition third-party social media buttons may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring Web site addresses, and, if you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link such collected information with your profile information on that site. We do not control these third party tracking technologies. Note that the \"s81c.com\" domain used to deliver static content on some of our Web sites is managed by IBM, and not by a third party.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline Advertising\\r\\nIBM does not deliver third party online advertisements on our Web sites but we advertise our products and services on others\\' Web sites. Please familiarize yourself with those Web site operators\\' or network advertisers\\' privacy policies to understand their practices relating to advertising, including what type of information they may collect about your Internet usage. Some advertising networks we may use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA). Individuals may opt-out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI or EDAA member ad networks by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org and http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/\\r\\nWe have also engaged with certain third parties to manage some of our advertising on other sites. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons to collect information (such as your IP address) about your activities on IBM\\'s and others\\' Web sites to provide you targeted IBM advertisements based upon your interests. In the U.S. and Canada, those IBM advertisements that are targeted to you will be identified with the AdChoices icon, as IBM participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory program for online behavioural advertising (see youradchoices.com and youradchoices.ca). You can click on the icon in the advertisements itself to manage your preferences. Or, if you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served non-targeted advertising. You will continue to receive generic, non-targeted ads.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nLinks to Non-IBM Web Sites and Third Party Applications\\r\\nTo allow you to interact with other Web sites on which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites) or join communities on such sites, we may provide links or embed third-party applications that allow you to login, post content or join communities from our Web sites.\\r\\nWe may also provide you with general links to non-IBM Web sites.\\r\\nYour use of these links and applications is subject to the third parties\\x92 privacy policies, and you should become familiar with the third party sites\\' privacy policies before using the links or applications.\\r\\nIBM is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Web sites.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nNotification of Changes\\r\\nWe will post a notice for 30 days at the top of this page notifying users when this Privacy Statement is updated or modified in a material way. If we are going to use your personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we can use your personal information in such a way.\\r\\nBack to top\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivacy Questions and Access\\r\\nIf you have a question about this Privacy Statement or IBM\\'s handling of your information, you can send an email to the IBM Web site coordinator. You can also contact us at:\\r\\nIBM\\'s Corporate Privacy Office\\r\\n1 New Orchard Road\\r\\nArmonk, NY 10540\\r\\nU.S.A.\\r\\nIn certain cases, you may have the ability to view or edit your personal information online. In the event your information is not accessible online, and you wish to obtain a copy of particular information you provided to IBM, or if you become aware the information is incorrect and you would like us to correct it, contact us.\\r\\nBefore IBM is able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to respond to your request. We will contact you within 30 days of your request.\\r\\nIf you no longer wish to receive marketing e-mails from IBM, please send an e-mail to NETSUPP@us.ibm.com or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email.\\r\\n', b'Twitpic Privacy Policy\\rThis Privacy Policy is effective as of February 1, 2008.\\rTwitpic Inc. (\\xd2Twitpic\\xd3) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Twitpic website located at www.twitpic.com and any linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Twitpic in connection therewith (the \\xd2Site\\xd3) and using Twitpic services (the \\xd2Services\\xd3), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.\\rThis Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.\\rThis policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Twitpic does not own or control, including but not limited to third party services you access though Twitpic, or to individuals that Twitpic does not employ or manage.\\rInformation Collected Upon Registration\\rIf you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Twitpic. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile.\\rAdditional Information\\rYour full user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to people on the Twitpic Site. Once a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional.\\rLog Data\\rWhen you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (\"Log Data\" ). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site\\'s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service\\rCookies\\rLike many websites, we also use \"cookie\" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer\\'s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Twitpic may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.\\rWe may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within Twitpic\\'s Sites, Services and Software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons. If you would like to contact the advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies with which we have relationships to learn more about their privacy policies and what options (if any) they offer to opt out of their data collection, please visit their web site(s). Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may \"opt out\" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks\\xcahere\\rIn addition, to trigger certain cookies, we may pass an encrypted or \\xd2hashed\\xd3 (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your twitter ID to a Web advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, those cookies. If you prefer not to receive interest based content and advertisements, or do not wish to enable other services which make use of Twitpic data, you can always opt-out by clicking\\xcahere. After you opt-out, Twitpic will not enable or serve interest-based content and targeted advertisements or enable the other services. Please note that opting-out does not turn off other advertisements. Also, if you change your computer, change your internet browser (e.g. from Internet Explorer to Firefox), or delete all your cookies, you will need to renew your preferences.\\rWeb Site Tracking, Reporting\\rMany of our web pages also contain special electronic images (called a \"single-pixel gif\" or \"gifs\") that allow us to gather only non-personally identifiable traffic statistics and other aggregate information about visitors to our sites. Twitpic (through itself or third parties) uses this technology to collect and accumulate anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the experience of people visiting our web sites and, along with other information you provide, customize your future visits and improve our web sites. Please keep in mind that none of this information is personally identifiable.\\rBanner Ads\\rThe Services may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider. The ad service provider may place or utilize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our sites, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. Twitpic is not responsible for the collection of these cookies and is not responsible for the actions of the ad service providers. Twitpic does not sponsor, endorse or guarantee any products or services advertised by third parties on its site.\\rInformation Sharing and Disclosure\\rInformation about our users is important to our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only as described below.\\rService Providers\\rWe engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.\\rThese companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.\\rInformation You Post\\rWhen you post a pic through Twitpic, information about you, including user profile information, may be visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, that information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and redistributed through the internet and other media channels. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.\\rBusiness Transfers\\rIn some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Twitpic, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Twitpic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Twitpic may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.\\rCompliance with Laws and Law Enforcement\\rTwitpic cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Twitpic or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.\\rNon-US Users\\rIf you are not a resident of the United States, you understand and agree that Twitpic stores and processes your information on computers located in the United States, and by providing any data to Twitpic, you consent to the transfer of such information to the United States.\\rSecurity Precautions\\rTwitpic has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained in whole or in part on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and may be stored on equipment or in facilities leased or licensed from third parties. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information and make all commercially reasonable efforts to do so, Twitpic cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. This privacy policy does not apply to any information, including such photographs, that you submit for use in publicly available areas. We ask that you do not submit any personal information, including contact information or financial information, for display in public areas, as other people who use the Services will see it. If you submit such information for display in public areas, Twipic cannot prevent it from being used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety. By submitting such information for display in public areas, you assume the risks and sole liability arising as a result of such information being displayed.\\rLinks to Other Websites\\rThe fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.\\rOur Policy Towards Children\\rThe Site is not directed to persons under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal identifiable Information, we will delete such information from our system.\\rQuestions or Concerns\\rIf you have any questions regarding this privacy policy or information that you have submitted to us you can contact us at:\\rEmail:\\rtwitpicsupport@twitter.com\\r\\r', b\"Important Information About Your Privacy and Protecting Your Identity\\r\\nProtecting Your Privacy\\r\\nWe're strongly committed to our relationship with you and want to be sure you understand the steps we have taken to protect your personal information.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Do The TD Bank Companies Do With Your Personal Information?

It's an essential part of our commitment to integrity, dedication, accountability and caring whenever we deal with our customers. \\r\\nThe B.C. Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) sets out rules around ICBC\\x92s ability to collect, use and disclose personal information. It also requires us to protect your personal information by keeping it secure.\\r\\n\\x93Personal information\\x94 includes any recorded information about you as an identifiable individual such as your name, address, driving record, or claims information. It would not include things that cannot be linked back to you, such as crash statistics for an intersection with names and identifying features of individuals removed.\\r\\nThe purpose of our Privacy Policy is to:\\r\\nhelp you understand ICBC\\x92s privacy commitments, and\\r\\ngive you information about where you can go with questions or concerns about privacy.\\r\\nHow we protect your privacy\\r\\nThe following principles reflect our commitment to safeguarding your personal information.\\r\\nOpen all / Close all\\r\\n1. Collection of personal information\\r\\n?We will only collect as much personal information from you as we need to provide you with the product, program or service you are requesting. We will not collect more information than we need.\\r\\n2. Purpose and manner of collection\\r\\n?When we collect personal information we will explain why we need it and, whenever possible, we will collect it directly from you. There are situations when ICBC does collect information about you indirectly (from others). One example of this is if you receive a licence suspension or violation ticket, that information would be sent to us by the police for entry into our systems.\\r\\n3.

CONSENT TO USE OF ANTI-CHEATING SOFTWARE\\r\\n\\r\\nOur software package - used to access and use the Services - contains certain features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable artificial (non-human) intelligence to play on Our site. Use of such 'bot' software programs violates Our Terms and Conditions of Use, where We deem it detrimental to other players. By installing Our software and using the Services, You consent to Our software performing the functions described in this section. Our software may perform any or all of the following functions in order to detect the use of illicit automated programs and ensure that We maintain a 'cheat free' environment for all users: (1) scan Your list of active software applications while You are using the Services; (2) scan Your list of active processes while You are using the Services; and (3) scan the files in Your Services and site-related program folders to ensure that only 'non-hacked' versions of Our software are being used.

Our software will not perform any random search of large portions of Your hard drive, equipment or files, and it will not transmit any information to Us or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify use of illicit automated programs as described above. Our software will not alter any files or information on Your computer or other equipment and will not interfere with the operation of any of Your applications. You may terminate use of Our software at any time by uninstalling Our software package.\\r\\n\\r\\n11.

THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that You provide to a third-party online site that links to or from the Services or any information collected by any third party administering Our affiliate program (if applicable) or any other program, since these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of Us.

Hoffmann La-Roche AG\\x92s Online Privacy Statement\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for visiting a Roche Website or interacting with us via e-mail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Roche, we understand that protecting the privacy of visitors to our Web sites is very important and that information about your health is particularly sensitive. That\\x92s why we have taken the necessary steps to meet worldwide data privacy requirements. We treat your \\x84personal data\\x93 according to the \\x84Roche Directive on the Protection of Personal Data\\x93, and to the laws of the EU, Switzerland and other applicable local laws which regulate the storage, process, access and transfer of personal data.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoche Web sites that display this privacy policy (\\x93policy\\x94) and that ask for any information from you are committed to collecting, maintaining, and securing personal information about you in accordance with this policy, as well as applicable laws, rules and regulations. This policy applies to personal information (as defined below) collected from Roche online resources and communications (such as Web sites, e-mail, and other online tools) that display a link to this policy. This policy does not apply to personal information collected from offline resources and communications, except in cases where such personal information is consolidated with personal information collected by Roche online. This policy also does not apply to third-party online resources to which Roche\\x92s Web sites may link, where Roche does not control the content or the privacy practices of such resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe only collect personally identifiable information about you if you choose to give it to us. We do not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties for their own marketing use unless you explicitly give us permission to do so. Please review this Privacy Statement to learn more about how we collect, use, share and protect information online.\\r\\nInformation Collected\\r\\nThere are two general methods that Roche uses to collect information from you online:\\r\\nInformation We Get\\r\\n- Personal identifiable information: You can visit our Web sites without providing any personal information. We may collect your personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other identifying information) only when you choose to submit it to us. We may also collect health information about you that you provide by responding to our questions or surveys. \\r\\n\\r\\n- Aggregate information: In some cases we also remove personal identifiers from data you provide to us and maintain it in aggregate form. We may combine this data with other information to produce anonymous, aggregated statistical information (e.g. number of visitors, originating domain name of the Internet Service Provider), helpful to us in improving our products and services. \\r\\nAutomatically Collected Information\\r\\nWe and some third party providers we work with automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us on our sites and in some e-mails we may send each other. Automatic technologies and services we use may include, for example, Web server logs/IP addresses, cookies, Web beacons and third party application and content tools.\\r\\nWeb Server Logs/IP Addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. Roche collects IP addresses to conduct system administration and report aggregate information to affiliates, business partners and/or vendors to conduct site analysis and Web site performance review. \\r\\n\\r\\nCookies. A cookie is a piece of information that is placed automatically on your computer\\x92s hard drive when you access certain Web sites. The cookie uniquely identifies your browser to the server. Cookies allow us to store information on the server to help make the Web experience better for you and to conduct site analysis and Web site performance review. Most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies, although you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Note, however, that some portions of our sites may not work properly if you refuse cookies. \\r\\n\\r\\nWeb Beacons. On certain Web pages or e-mails, Roche may utilize a common Internet technology called a \"Web beacon\" (also known as an \"action tag\" or \"clear GIF technology\"). Web beacons help analyze the effectiveness of Web sites by measuring, for example, the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeb beacons, cookies and other tracking technologies do not automatically obtain personally identifiable information about you. Only if you voluntarily submit personally identifiable information, such as by registering or sending e-mails, can these automatic tracking technologies be used to provide further information about your use of the Web sites and/or interactive e-mails to improve their usefulness to you.\\r\\nServices: We may provide services based on third party applications and content tools on certain Roche Websites such as Google Maps or QUARTAL FLIFE. These third parties may automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us on our sites using such third party applications and tools.\\r\\nYour Choices\\r\\nYou have several choices regarding your use of our Web sites. You could decide not to submit any personally identifiable information at all by not entering it into any forms or data fields on our sites and not using any available personalized services. If you choose to submit personal data, you have the right to see and correct your data at any time by accessing the application. Certain sites may ask for your permission for certain uses of your information and you can agree to or decline those uses. If you opt-in for particular services or communications, such as an e-newsletter, you will be able to unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included in each communication. If you decide to unsubscribe from a service or communication, we will work to remove your information promptly, although we may require additional information before we can process your request. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs described above, if you wish to prevent cookies from tracking you anonymously as you navigate our sites, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\\r\\nSecurity\\r\\nRoche uses technology and security precautions, rules and other procedures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use, disclosure, loss or destruction. To ensure the confidentiality of your information, Roche uses also industry standard firewalls and password protection. It is, however, your personal responsibility to ensure that the computer you are using is adequately secured and protected against malicious software, such as trojans, computer viruses and worm programs. You are aware of the fact that without adequate security measures (e.g. secure web browser configuration, up-to-date antivirus software, personal firewall software, no usage of software from dubious sources) there is a risk that the data and passwords you use to protect access to your data, could be disclosed to unauthorized third parties.\\r\\nUse of Data\\r\\nRoche, including the subsidiaries, divisions and groups worldwide and/or the companies we hire to perform services on our behalf will use any personally identifiable information you choose to give us to comply with your requests. We will retain control of and responsibility for the use of this information. Some of this data may be stored or processed at computers located in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live.

In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, Site Owner may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinks to Other Sites\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to note that Site Owner may contain links to other sites and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Site Owner. For instance, if you click on a link, it may take you away from the Site Owner website and to an entirely different site. This can include links from content providers, authors, and partners.

The Boeing Company and its family of companies (\\x93Boeing\\x94) are sensitive to the issue of confidentiality in online interactions and are committed to protecting individual privacy across our range of websites, products and services (\\x93Sites\\x94). This Policy is intended to inform you about the approach Boeing Sites displaying this Policy follow when collecting, using and disclosing your information.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat data do we collect automatically and why?\\r\\nWhen you visit Boeing Sites and you have not otherwise identified yourself (e.g., via registration with a Boeing Site), our web servers automatically recognize your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We collect the domain name and monitor general site use and traffic patterns to improve the Sites that we offer. Boeing uses web server logs to collect data for metrics purposes. Examples of the types of data collected in the logs are IP addresses, referral pages, date and time of site access, and site visited. We may use collected data to customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo we use cookies or tracers on our Sites?\\r\\nCookies are small data files placed on your device by a website when you visit. Boeing may use cookies set by us or other companies for tracking purposes or to make our Sites easier to use. Cookies are currently the best way to effectively identify unique website visitors and understand how they navigate our Sites. Like many websites, we do not currently respond to \\x93do not track\\x94 browser headers. But with most internet browsers, you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your device and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your device is up to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some instances, Boeing uses tracking scripts or \"tracers\" that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your device by another website. These are used by Boeing to gauge the success of our programs, such as advertising campaigns. For instance, we may use a tracer to determine whether you visit our employment pages after visiting a resume or career site where we placed a banner ad.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile our cookie names may change over the course of time, they generally fall into the following categories:\\r\\n\\r\\nCategories\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples\\r\\n\\r\\nSite Features \\r\\nand Processes\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cookies help us deliver products and services that you expect, such as maintaining your shopping cart, processing payments, navigating around Sites, and using live chat to interact with customer service representatives. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Without these cookies, our Sites cannot function properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSite Preferences\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cookies allow our Sites to remember information that changes the way the Site behaves or looks, such as your preferred language or the region you are in. These cookies can also assist you in changing text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can personalize. Without these cookies, our Sites cannot function properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSite Improvement\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cookies help us improve our Sites and your browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section \\x93Do we use cookies or tracers on our Sites?\\x94.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalytics\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cookies help us understand how visitors engage with our Sites through collection of usage statistics. Examples of the types of data collected include IP addresses, referral pages, date and time of Site access, and Site visited. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section \\x93Do third parties use cookies or tracers on our Sites?\\x94.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvertising and \\r\\nRemarketing\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cookies are used to understand and deliver ads, make them more relevant to you, and analyze the effectiveness of our programs such as employee recruiting campaigns. They may use the fact that you visited our Sites to target online ads for Boeing services to you on non-Boeing websites. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section \\x93Do we participate in interest-based advertising?\\x94.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial Features\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cookies allow you to more easily share our Site content on social networks, or share your comments with other Site visitors. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section \\x93Do third parties use cookies or tracers on our Sites?\\x94.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity and \\r\\nAuthentication\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cookies are used to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties. Without these cookies, certain Sites features cannot function properly.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDo third parties use cookies or tracers on our Sites?\\r\\nBoeing Sites often contain cookies or similar technologies from third-party providers, which help us compile statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, perform analytics, enable social networking features such as sharing Boeing content or leaving Site comments, and other operations.

Examples of personal information include name, phone number, e-mail address, and mailing address.

Boeing will store your personal information for as long as you use the App, and no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or for which it is legitimately further processed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclosure: Boeing will share your personal information as indicated in the section \\x93When would we disclose your information?\\x94.\\r\\n\\r\\nUser Control: Access, correction, or deletion requests for your personal information can be made by emailing us here.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation Information: If you have first provided permission through your device, Boeing may obtain pinpointed physical location information from technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity.

Access, correction, or deletion requests for your personal information can be made by emailing us here.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do we keep current?\\r\\nFrom time to time, Boeing may revise this Policy at its discretion.

(Kenilworth, NJ, USA), which operates as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada, established a Privacy Office to develop and oversee a global privacy program for our operations around the world. Our program is based on four privacy values that provide the foundation for responsible engagement, interactions and use of information about people:\\r\\n\\r\\nrespect for individual privacy expectations,\\r\\nbuilding and preserving trust,\\r\\npreventing privacy harms, and\\r\\ncompliance with the letter and spirit of privacy and data protection laws around the world.\\r\\nOur privacy program is built on a platform of organizational accountability for privacy, stewardship of the data we use to operate our business, consistent global privacy practices and standards that carry on our tradition of upholding high ethical standards across our business practices, and ongoing oversight to ensure that we continue to respond to changes in privacy expectations as technology and our business continue to evolve. For more information about our program, please see the global privacy program section of our corporate responsibility report.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Approach to Privacy Trust\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we believe that trust is a core privacy value and essential to our corporate mission to discover, develop and provide innovative products and services that save and improve lives around the world, our global privacy program strategy is centered on two primary goals that aim to drive trust in how we engage with people and how we access, use and transfer information about people around the world:\\r\\n\\r\\nConsistent Global Standards\\r\\nSince we established our global privacy program in 2001, we have worked to implement and uphold consistent global privacy standards to provide assurance for how we manage our privacy and data protection obligations across countries and regions and to support our certifications under the following privacy frameworks recognized by regulators:\\r\\n\\r\\nUS-EU Safe Harbor (2001)\\r\\nUS-Swiss Safe Harbor (2009)\\r\\nAPEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (2013)\\r\\nEach of our certifications is based on our Cross Border Privacy Rules Policy\\r\\n\\r\\nTransparency\\r\\nWe recognize that it can be difficult and overwhelming for people to understand all of the different ways that information about them can be observed, sensed, collected, shared, used, analyzed and transferred, so we use a variety of approaches to support our goal of making our practices transparent both to people about whom we process information as well as the regulators and their agents who review our practices. Key examples include:\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline Privacy \\x96 our Internet Privacy Policy describes the ways in which we process information about people online;\\r\\nCookies \\x96 our Cookie Privacy Commitment supports our Internet and describes the ways in which our web sites and online services use cookies and other online trackers;\\r\\nComprehensive Privacy Notices \\x96 these are intended to provide a thorough perspective on how our privacy practices apply to specific stakeholders.;\\r\\nMobile App Privacy as a supplement to our Internet Privacy Policy we provide certain mobile app privacy disclosures below;\\r\\nProtection of Social Security Numbers and other government-issued identification numbers; and\\r\\nContextual Notices \\x96 which we provide at the time you use or participate in our services.\\r\\nFor more information, please see Transparency and Privacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAPEC Privacy Certification\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 31, 2013, our global privacy program was certified as compliant with the requirements of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) system. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. We were the first healthcare company in the world, and the second multinational company, to achieve this certification. Achievement of APEC certification demonstrates to our customers, patients, and other stakeholders our strong commitment to accountable, values-based, privacy and data protection practices in every region of the world in which we operate.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur certification by the U.S. APEC Accountability Agent, TRUSTe, applies to our business processes across our operations that transfer personal information from our affiliates in the U.S. to our affiliates in other countries. Since all of our operations globally participate in our global privacy program and adhere to a common set of privacy practice and standards, we anticipate that our affiliates in other APEC member economies will be recognized as CBPR-certified for transfers of personal information that originate in those economies after those economies are approved as participants in the APEC CBPR system.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information, please read our Cross Border Privacy Rules Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSafe Harbor Certification\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 5, 2001, we certified our adherence to the Safe Harbor Agreement between the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce for transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area to the U.S. We have reaffirmed our adherence to the Safe Harbor annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 31, 2007, we extended our Safe Harbor standards to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the U.S. In 2009, we certified our adherence to the Safe Harbor Framework agreed upon by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland and the U.S Department of Commerce for transfers of personal information from Switzerland to the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information, please read our Cross Border Privacy Rules Policy.

This privacy policy applies to transactions and activities and data gathered through the Lyft Platform. Please review this privacy policy periodically as We may revise it without notice. This privacy policy was last revised on December 8, 2014 . Each time You use the Lyft Platform or provide Us with information, by doing so You are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.\\n\\nData We Collect From You\\n\\nIn order to operate the Lyft Platform and to provide You with information about products or services that may be of interest to You, We may collect \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonal information\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (i.e. information that could be used to contact You directly (without using the Lyft Platform) such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address) or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdemographic information\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (i.e. information that You submit, or that We collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information). We will also collect the contact information of Your friends, if You choose to connect Your contacts and address book information with Lyft and Your login credentials to Your social network accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, if You choose to connect those accounts with your Lyft account. You represent and warrant that You have the authority to provide Us with any such contact information. Demographic information is divided into two categories:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-public information\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which consists of ride transaction information and one-on-one communications between You and other users of the Lyft Platform; and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpublic information\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which consists of all other demographic information.\\nPlease note that nowhere on the Lyft Platform do We knowingly collect, keep or maintain personal information from children under the age of 18, as We require that all users represent to Us that they are at least 18 years old.\\nHow We Use Personal Information\\n\\nWe use Your email address and Your other personal information to help Us efficiently operate the Lyft Platform, to contact You in connection with Your transactions and other activities on the Lyft Platform (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could affect Your relationship with Lyft), to forward trip information to You from other Users, to forward trip information from You to other Users, and to contact You and others to suggest potential matches. We use Your contact information to find and connect with Your friends (when instructed by You). These types of communications are known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOperational Communications.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.\\n\\nTo operate the Lyft Platform, including processing Your transactions and supporting Your activities on the Lyft Platform, We may share Your personal information with Our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide Us with support services such as email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management services, and order fulfillment. We require these entities not to use Your information for any other purpose.\\n\\nBy purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the Lyft Platform, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or material by mail) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Lyft Platform, You consent to Our providing Your personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use Your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding Your preferences for the use of Your personal information by them. Additionally, You agree that We may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which We are entitled to use and disclose any other information You submit to Us.\\n\\nAny third party with whom We are allowed to share Your personal information is authorized to use Your personal information in accordance with Our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which We have no control, and You agree that We are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact You will need to be instructed directly by You regarding Your preferences for the use of Your personal information by them.\\n\\nHow We Use Demographic Data\\n\\nWe may review all demographic Data. We may use public information to enable other users to search Your profile, to determine whether Your trip details fit other user's requirements, and to communicate with You. We may use demographic information to tailor the Lyft Platform and communications to Your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers Your identity). One of the reasons We may do this is to increase the likelihood that Our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to You as a user of the Lyft Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., We do not tell advertisers which particular Lyft Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When You respond to an advertisement, however, We ask You to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and You decide to give the advertiser Your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify You as being a member of that demographic group.\\n\\nHow to Edit Your Information\\n\\nLyft provides You with the ability to access and edit Your personal information. To update Your personal info, click Settings in the Lyft menu. There You can view, update and correct Your account information.\\n\\nSo that We can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as Your age, that You cannot alter Yourself.\\n\\nOur databases automatically update any personal information You edit in Your profile, or that You request We edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remain in Our databases and become the property of Lyft upon submission. Keep this in mind if You decide to communicate personal information through any of these applications.\\n\\nInformation Retention\\n\\nTo preserve the integrity of Our databases, standard procedure calls for Us to retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. Lyft understands Your submissions as consent to store all Your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if We so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), We will nullify member information by erasing it from Our database. We will also respond to written member requests to nullify account information. Also, by using the Lyft Platform, You do hereby represent and warrant that You understand and agree that all information submitted by You through the Lyft Platform or otherwise to Lyft becomes the property of Lyft and may be used in the sole discretion of Lyft in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.\\n\\nChoice/Opt-Out\\n\\nLyft provides Users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Us and Our partners at the point where We request information about the visitor. Lyft gives Users the option to remove their information from Our database, to not receive future communications or to no longer receive Our service.\\n\\nSpecial Cases in Which We Share Personal Information\\n\\nYour personal information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose personal information when We determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of Lyft or other visitors to the Lyft Platform. We also may disclose Your personal information to Our subsidiary and parent companies and businesses, and other affiliated legal entities and businesses with whom We are under common corporate control. Whenever personal information is disclosed under this paragraph, We may also disclose Your demographic information along with it, on a non-anonymous basis. All of Our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive Your personal information or non-anonymous demographic information from Us will comply with the terms of this privacy policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information.\\n\\nOur Security Precautions\\n\\nYour Lyft Profile is password-protected so that only You and authorized Lyft employees have access to Your account information. If You have registered for Lyft using Facebook Connect, then Your login and password shall be the same as Your Facebook login and password. In order to maintain this protection, do not give Your password to anyone. Lyft staff will never proactively reach out to You and ask for any personal account information, including Your password. If You share a computer, You should sign out of Your Lyft account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect Your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.\\n\\nLyft makes every effort to ensure that Your information is secure on its system. Lyft has staff dedicated to maintaining Our privacy policy as set forth herein and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing Web security and making sure that every Lyft employee is aware of Our security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Lyft cannot guarantee the security of any information You transmit to Us, and You do so at Your own risk. If You have any further questions on this issue, refer to Lyft Terms of Use. Lyft expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information You submit to the Lyft Platform.\\n\\nLyft has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Our control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which You reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in Your country or jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe Lyft Platform may contain links to other web sites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage Our Users to be aware when they leave the Lyft Platform to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Lyft Platform.\\n\\nChanging our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information\\n\\nIf at any point We decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, We will notify Users by way of an email or by providing 30 days notice on the Lyft Platform. We also encourage You to review this privacy policy periodically. By using the Lyft Platform, You do hereby represent and warrant that You have read, understand and agree to all terms of Agreement. Each time You use the Lyft Platform, You agree to all terms set forth in this Agreement and any other policies published by Lyft on the Lyft Platform. Please note that We will continue to have the right to change Our privacy policy and practices, and how We use Your personally identifiable information, without notice, as described in herein, provided that such changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.\\n\\nContacting Lyft\\n\\nIf You have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of Lyft, or Your dealings with Lyft, You may contact Us at our support center.\\n\\n\", b'Privacy Policy\\r\\nAmerican International Group (\\x93AIG\\x94) and its subsidiaries and affiliates (each an \\x93AIG Company\\x94, \\x93AIG Companies\\x94, \\x93we\\x94 or \\x93us\\x94) is committed to protecting the privacy of the individuals we encounter in conducting our business.\\x93Personal Information\\x94 is information that identifies and relates to you or other individuals (such as your dependents).
